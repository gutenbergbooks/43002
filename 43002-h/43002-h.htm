<h2>EDITOR'S PREFACE</h2>


<p>The History of Grasmere contained in this little
volume was nearly ready for the press when the
author, who was working on it to the very last, was
taken away. For several years she had been collecting
material, leaving no stone unturned to get at facts and
records from the earliest times, and at last she was
arranging for its publication. Her modest estimate of
the value of her work made her often anxious, but her
keen love of investigating the antiquities of her neighbourhood
and country kept her always eager. To a
kindred spirit nothing could be more interesting than
to visit with her some old hall or farm or even a site
which her historic knowledge could furnish with its
original buildings, and people with its old-world inhabitants.
What she most desired was to see for herself
what she wished to write about, or, if that were impossible,
something similar which still existed, and she had a
genius for reconstructing, which made her deductions
and suggestions singularly valuable.</p>

<p>She was at no time strong, and for this reason her
work was perpetually liable to interruption, still her
indomitable courage and her endless patience enabled
her to do wonders, and, though never able to work for
long together, bit by bit she got through a great deal.
How hard she worked and how carefully, no one who
reads her book, and sees the number of facts she has
got together, and notes the numerous references to
books which she had examined, can fail to perceive.
Over and over again she had to give in for a time, but
her bright intelligence quickly reasserted itself, and she
was ready on most days to discuss the subjects which
for the time absorbed her. And this she did with a
delighted eagerness, and always with that humour
which is the salt of all conversation and companionship.
On birds and their habits she spoke with authority,
and could always contribute much valuable information
obtained by personal observation. Generally the first
to hear and see the newly arrived summer migrants,
and able to distinguish the note of each, she thought
no trouble too great if it led to the chance of seeing
some rare kind nesting in the neighbourhood. Equally
keenly would she follow up the threads of some local
history, for she had the true scientific spirit and a genuine
passion for archæology, so that by constant study she
had accumulated a surprising mass of information relating
to old historic Westmorland, and to Ambleside, Rydal
and Grasmere in particular. Of Ambleside she has
already published a little pamphlet, called <cite>Ambleside
Town and Chapel</cite>. The present volume is her completed
work on Grasmere; and the History of Rydal, and
more especially of Rydal Hall, a more considerable
work on which she had been engaged for many years,
has advanced so far that we hope soon to see it published.
Indeed some chapters of it have already appeared in
the columns of the <cite>Westmorland Gazette</cite>.</p>

<p>We had long ago arranged that I should help in seeing
her work through the press; and with her usual thoroughness
and care, she had got the present volume so far
ready that my task has been but a superficial one, accompanied
throughout by the "one pure image of regret"
that she did not live to see, herself, the fruits of her
long labour.</p>

<p>Grasmere draws many pilgrims in these latter days.
It has become the Shrine of Nature and Poetry,
for within its graveyard lies buried nature's austerest and
most sincere interpreter. The natural beauty of the spot,
combined with its associations, has given rise to a copious
literature; and its praises have been rehearsed in poetry
and prose of a high order. But by the historian Grasmere
has been neglected. Its geographical position has tended
to its eclipse. In ancient times locked up from the world
in the farthest chamber of the mountains, and still the
remotest parish of Westmorland (itself a neglected county),
it has missed the attention of the careful chronicler, and
no serious attempt has been made to penetrate its past.
James Torre (1649-1699) indeed in his MS. collections for
a history of the Archdeaconry of Richmondshire, compiled
a list of five rectors who had served the parish of
Grasmere before the Reformation; but no searcher has
followed up his efforts. Nor has the excellent, though
necessarily limited, information given in the pages of
Nicolson and Burn (1770) been since filled up or supplemented.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>The following historical sketch makes no pretensions to
completeness, which would be beyond both the writer's
powers and opportunities. It began as a small thing, a
chapter merely in the yet unfinished "Chronicles of Rydal."
But there seemed a need for the publication of such facts
as had been gathered together; and in response to an
expressed desire, the sketch that had been laid by was
overhauled, expanded and prepared for press. It contains
(there is little doubt) some unsuspected errors and
oversights, for which the reader's leniency is asked.</p>

<p>The information has been collected from many sources,
public, private, and traditional. The earliest comes from
the Record Office, where there are treasures still to be
explored. For the seventeenth century&mdash;and particularly
the period of the Civil Wars&mdash;the MSS. at Rydal
Hall have yielded facts of great interest, especially those
culled from the account-sheets of Mr. Richard Harrison,
who was agent and executor of Squire John Fleming.</p>

<p>From all sources, however, the information obtained is
fragmentary, and facts are disappointingly isolated. Always
there is something beyond, that we want to know
and cannot find out; and so the story of the great Restoration
Tithe Dispute has no ending. The Presentments
have been only available for a limited number of years.
The church registers are defective. Even the church-wardens'
accounts, which begin at the Restoration, are
not complete. It is fortunate, however, that the second
volume of these accounts, long missing, and strangely
recovered from papers found at the house of descendants
of a former parish clerk, was copied before it was again
lost. There is a gap of seven years between the third
volume and this copy, owing no doubt to the last leaves
of the second volume having been torn off.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p>The writer has received more help and kindness than
can well be acknowledged. Thanks are specially due to
Mr. Stanley le Fleming and Sir Gerald Strickland for
granting ready access to their muniments; to Dr. Magrath,
author of <cite>The Flemings in Oxford</cite>; to the Revs. W.
Jennings, J. H. Heywood, and M. F. Peterson for permitting
the church documents to be consulted; to Messrs.
W. Farrer, J. A. Martindale, and George Browne for their
kind contributions of antiquarian knowledge; to Mr. W.
Buckton I am indebted for the plan of the church.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTORY" id="INTRODUCTORY"></a>INTRODUCTORY</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">How the Church was founded in Northumbria</span></p>


<p>All history begins with geography. Grasmere was
from early times the centre of a parish that
embraced the twin valleys of Rothay and Brathay, whose
waters drain into the lake of Windermere, while the lake
empties itself into the great bay of Morecambe. Therefore
Grasmere has always belonged politically to the
fertile region round about the bay, and the history of
that region&mdash;from the time when the Celt enjoyed it,
onward through its conquest by the Angle, its aggregation
with the province of Deira and the kingdom of Northumbria,
still onward through its conversion to Christianity
and its connection with the central church government
at York as part of the Archdeaconry of Richmondshire&mdash;is
the history of Grasmere herself: and to understand the
origin of her church, it is necessary to briefly indicate
the main events in the kingdom of Northumbria and the
Church of York.</p>

<p>The actual rise of Christianity within the valleys can
only be conjectured. The Celts who dwelt here through
the rule of the Roman may not have embraced the faith,
but some whisper of Saint Ninian's mission must surely
have come to them, if not his direct teaching, as he passed
on his way from Rome through Cumberland, to found at
Whithorn in Galway a new religious community, like the
one his great teacher Saint Martin had founded at Tours.
The mission of Saint Patrick too, who in the fifth century
returned to finish the work of conversion and church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
establishment in Ireland, must have been noised abroad,
for his name is imprinted on many a spot hereabouts;
Patterdale or Patricdale,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> with its well named after him,
being distant barely ten miles from Grasmere.</p>

<p>The holy Kentigern is known to have made missionary
excursions from Carlisle into the mountains, before 573;
and Crosthwaite, where he planted a cross, is but 13 miles
from Grasmere, along the line of the Roman road from
Kendal to Old Carlisle. With this artery of communication
open, it is impossible that tidings of the new faith
should not have reached our valley before the close of
the sixth century.</p>

<p>Soon these tidings were to come from the east as well
as the west, borne by the triumphant arms of the invading
Angles. Truly Ethelfrith who, in winning the battle of
Chester, first laid our mountain fastnesses open to his
kingdom of Northumbria, was a heathen; but his successor
Edwin embraced Christianity and brought Paulinus,
a member of Saint Augustine's mission, to preach the
gospel (627). At York, the capital of the kingdom, a
Christian church was built, a second one even being
started in stone to replace the wooden structure; and the
new bishop moved about with the king and his court,
preaching and baptizing. The valleys of Northumberland
and Yorkshire, which were the scenes of his labours, are
named by Bede, who knew them well; but it is not known
that he crossed into Westmorland.</p>

<p>Edwin's overthrow gave Northumbria to the pagan king
of Mercia, but it was soon regained by Oswald, who identified
himself completely with the new faith. He brought
Aidan, who had been educated in the Celtic Church (now
firmly settled in Scotland) to fill the place of the departed
Paulinus. But instead of taking up the bishop's seat at
York, Aidan with the strong predilection shown by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
church for island-sanctuaries, chose Lindisfarne to be the
centre of his missionary efforts in Northumbria. Here
Finan succeeded him in 651, and rebuilt the first rude
edifice, constructing it of hewn oak thatched with reeds.</p>

<p>King Oswald (slain at Maserfeld, 642) was shortly after
succeeded by Oswy, an ardent disciple of the new faith,
as was Alchfrith his son. Alchfrith acted as sub-king in
Northumbria under his father.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> He endowed a monastery
at Ripon, which was presumably within his dominion,
and placed there Eata, abbot of Melrose, with a little
band of Scotic monks. At this time there was a young
priest named Wilfrith, lately returned from a journey to
Rome (658), with whom Alchfrith made fast friends.
Convinced by Wilfrith that the practices of the Anglo-Scotic
church, where they differed from those of Western
Europe, were mistaken, he turned out the monks of
Ripon, when they refused to alter their customs, and gave
the establishment over to Wilfrith, to rule as abbot.
The kings attempted to settle the differences of practice
between the churches at the synod of Whitby (664),
where the counsels of the Roman party under Wilfrith
prevailed; and this caused the retirement of Colman,
bishop of Northumbria, who refused to conform. It was
now necessary to supply his place, and the kings, father
and son, seem without disagreement to have selected each
his own man, presumably for his own province; thus
making two bishops instead of one.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> While Alchfrith
chose Wilfrith for his bishop, and sent him to Gaul for
consecration, Oswy chose Chad, sending him to Kent to
be consecrated as Bishop of York "for him and his"
by the Archbishop. But by the time that Wilfrith had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
returned from his foreign journey, things were changed at
the court. Alchfrith was dead, possibly slain in rebellion
against his father; and Wilfrith, deprived of his patron,
settled down quietly at Ripon as abbot, while Chad ruled
the whole church of Northumbria from York.</p>

<p>But when Oswy died (670 or 671) and his son Ecgfrith
succeeded, Chad retired, and Wilfrith was made sole
Bishop. Now began a very active and happy period of
his life. Enjoying undivided power, a position which
suited his nature, he moved about his huge diocese,
everywhere creating new foundations and building fresh
churches. With skilled workmen under him, he was the
great architect and builder of his time. First he turned
his attention to the head church in York, which had
become, since Oswald's days, ruinous. After building
there an edifice unique in its time, he took his masons to
Ripon, and there he built a basilica of dressed stone with
pillars and arches and porches. He also enriched its
altar with vases, and a vestment of purple and gold, and
laid upon it a book of the Gospels, marvellously illumined,
and enclosed in a gold and jewelled case. Wilfrith made
the dedication of this church, which was attended by
King Ecgfrith, and by tributary kings, reeves and abbots,
an occasion of great splendour. Standing before the altar,
with his face towards the concourse of people, he recited
the names of the lands with which Ripon was endowed,
as also of certain sanctuaries of the Britons which were
taken over by it.</p>

<p>Now this enumeration of lands, said to be given by
princes with the consent of the bishops, is of great interest.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Were these lands within Alchfrith's former sub-kingdom&mdash;the
nucleus being his monastic endowment?&mdash;and was it
intended to create a bishopric there at Ripon, separate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
from the one at York? Certainly the great tracts of
country mentioned were to be ecclesiastically ruled from
Ripon, whether by abbot or bishop.</p>

<p>Moreover, in the confused and certainly corrupt list of
names that has come down to us of Wilfrith's remarkable
recitation, several have been localized within that last
conquered portion of Northumbria lying to the west,
which may have been called by the Celts who lost it,
Teyrnllwg.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Whatever had been Alchfrith's intentions about Ripon,
Wilfrith's were clear in thus making it the church centre
for a district as wide as a diocese. In effect, it was a
diocese; though only for a short time was there a recognized
Bishop of Ripon. And this was after Ecgfrith and
Wilfrith had unhappily quarrelled, and Wilfrith had been
expelled from Northumbria, when Theodore, the new
archbishop, who had been called north to re-organize the
huge diocese, made finally five bishoprics out of it; and
Eadhed (after temporarily ruling a see at Lindsey) became,
according to Bede, the Bishop of Ripon. But upon the
reconciliation of Wilfrith with King Aldfrith, who succeeded
Ecgfrith, Eadhed retired from Ripon, and Wilfrith
again took possession of it, and ruled it&mdash;though only as
abbot&mdash;until his death.</p>

<p>Wilfrith's inauguration of Ripon, which took place in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the period of his sole prelacy of Northumbria (671 to 678)
was then an event of great importance for the district
round the great Bay, and for Grasmere; indeed it is hardly
too much to say that its results lasted over a thousand
years. For in spite of the bishop's loss of power, his
scheme ultimately held good. When the long dark days
of Danish anarchy were passed, the western district which
he gathered in to the fold of Ripon emerged as an ecclesiastical
entity, and it kept its bounds through the administrative
changes of the Norman kings, which carved out
of it the barony of Kendal, and made of it parts of
Westmorland, Cumberland, Yorkshire and Lancashire.
The archdeaconry of Richmondshire, which was formally
constituted a section of the diocese of York in 1090, is
in fact almost identical with Wilfrid's province of Ripon.
It is true that Ripon ceased to be its centre, that establishment
sinking again into a monastery, which lay indeed a
few miles beyond the boundary of Richmondshire; while
a new centre was created at Richmond, a little town
without significance standing in another Yorkshire vale.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
This great church province was ruled over by an archdeacon,
who possessed almost the powers of a bishop,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
until it was transferred by Henry the Eighth in 1541 from
the diocese of York to that of Chester; and it remained
intact until 1847, when it was broken up among what are
now the dioceses of Carlisle, Manchester, and Ripon.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Our
own part of it became the archdeaconry of Westmorland,
under Carlisle.</p>

<p>After Wilfrith had lost favour at the Northumbrian
court, and carried his grievances to Rome, King Ecgfrith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
secured the co-operation of Theodore, archbishop of
Canterbury (669) in the organization of the Northern
Church. As has been said, there are indications that
church work went on busily in the district of the great
Bay. St. Cuthbert, who had served his apprenticeship as
a monk at Ripon, was made bishop in 685 and administered
his great See from Lindisfarne. Into his charge
Ecgfrith expressly gave Cartmel with its Britons, and the
newly-conquered district round Carlisle. Carlisle became
indeed a thriving church centre, with royal nunnery and
monastery, and with missions spreading round it. Bede
has drawn a striking picture of the bishop's visit to the
ruined Roman city, when a vision of the king's overthrow
came upon him; as well as of his last meeting with St.
Herebert, the hermit of Derwentwater, who was wont
every year to seek his counsel. The district of Cartmel
he placed in the charge of the "good Abbot Cineferth,"
as if it were too distant from Lindisfarne for his immediate
care. But, while his own easiest route to Carlisle would
be by the straight road along the Roman Wall, he would
not be ignorant of that other road striking northwards
through the mountains from the great Bay. He may,
indeed, have travelled this road himself on his missionary
journeys, and even have halted to preach in the vale of
Grasmere. It is certain at least that some of the holy
men working for the Anglo-Scottish Church at this period
must have done so. With the defeat and death of Ecgfrith
the glory of the Northumbrian kingdom came to an
end indeed; but the church continued to prosper; and
in the two hundred years between that event and the
final relinquishment of Lindisfarne as a See, on through
the ravages of the Danes, it wrought a mighty work, not
only in the old kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira, but in
the region westward. Many of our existing foundations
may well date back from that time; and it is probable
that the ruined or entirely vanished chapels of our district<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
were built in that age of piety.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> We know from Bede
that there was a monastery at Dacre in Cumberland,
which existed at least until 926.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> It has been suggested
that a certain monastery, founded by a Northumbrian
nobleman in the reign of Osred (slain in 717) was situated
at Heversham in Westmorland.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Certainly at Heversham
may be seen the fragments of a cross wrought in patterns
such as experts ascribe to the Anglian school of workmanship
introduced by Wilfrith.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Then too a thrilling event in hagiological history touched
our parts nearly. When the monks of Lindisfarne fled
before the ravaging Danes with St. Cuthbert's body, they
went westward for safety, and their wanderings brought
them into Cumberland and Westmorland.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> A gap in
their travels which the antiquary has yet failed to trace
may possibly have been filled by a route through Craven&mdash;that
perpetual haunt of refugees&mdash;and about Morecambe
Bay.</p>

<p>Certainly a well-used road must have passed not far
from our district in the days of Northumbrian anarchy,
when Danish kings and allies reigned alike at York and
at Dublin. Windermere indeed is associated with the
murder (741) of two young princes of the royal house.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<h2><a name="THE_DEDICATION" id="THE_DEDICATION"></a>THE DEDICATION</h2>


<p>To the question so often asked, When was the church
of Grasmere founded? no more than a conjectural
answer can be given. The district formed part&mdash;though
a remote one&mdash;of Northumbria, and doubtless shared in
the conversion of that kingdom. Even before that time
it may have been touched by those successive missionary
efforts, which have been happily classed as the Romano-British
of Ninian at the end of the fourth century, the
Irish of Patrick in the fifth century, and the Kymric of
Kentigern in the sixth; and these efforts were followed
up by the steady work of the Anglo-Scottish monks,
and the establishment under the Anglian kings of an
organized church.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The dedication of the Grasmere church favours the
supposition that its foundation was early. Its name-saint
is King Oswald, who planted a cross as a standard
in the battle by which he gained Northumbria, and who
was killed at Maserfeld by the heathen Penda in 642. He
became the idol of the Northumbrian christians, and his
relics were cherished in many a shrine. When danger
threatened Lindisfarne, his head was placed for safety in
the coffin of St. Cuthbert;<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and with this sacred burden
the monks, as stated above, fled westward, wandering for
years in parts adjacent to Westmorland, if they did not
actually cross its borders.</p>

<p>A well in the Grasmere valley shared the dedication
with the church, and indeed may have been antecedent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
to it, as a place of resort. It is at the foot of Kelbarrow
(formerly Kelbergh,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> the hill of the spring); and the Celts
were wont to decorate their <em>kels</em> or springs with votive
offerings of a heathen kind. The church, however, always
took care to possess herself of such wells, absorbing any
sanctification that was ascribed to them; and the water
of St. Oswald's well continued to be carried to the church
for baptisms until quite recent times.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Church and well are not, however, close together. The
well springs in the flat meadow between the path to the
Wray and Wray Beck, but it is now covered in. The
adjacent bay of the lake is called Well-foot, and the bridge
over the beck has the same name; and when the Wray
property was "boundered" in 1683, the "welfoot bridge"
was spoken of.</p>

<p>It is suggestive that the farmstead close by owns the
name of Pavement End, being formerly known as Padmire.
Could it be proved that the name is an ancient
one, the idea that the spot was much resorted to of old
would be confirmed, since the causeway went so far and
no farther.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>



<h2><a name="THE_SITE" id="THE_SITE"></a>THE SITE</h2>


<p>The present site of the church may not have been
the original one. It is hardly a likely halting-place
for a travelling preacher. The Roman road which traversed
the valley could neither have been the present one,
that leads to church and village, nor the straight cut from
Town End that passes the Swan Inn. Both of these cross
the flat bottom; and the Romans from the summit of
White Moss (by which they certainly entered the vale)
would never have dropped into the marsh below (even
now water-logged in places), only to climb out again, to
that gap of the Raise that plainly beckoned them to their
goal northward. Instead, they would maintain their level
as far as might be, and keep along the firm slope of the
fells at a height of some 300 to 400 feet; then, with only
two rapid becks to ford, they would come easily and gradually
to the ascent of the pass. It is interesting to find
that along this presumed route there exists a line of
scattered homesteads; while the modern road below was&mdash;until
the recent spurt in building, vacant but for a cottage
and the Swan Inn; and this last stands in reality on an
ancient cross "loaning" between the higher road suggested,
and the village. Many of these homesteads have been
turned into houses for the wealthy, and great alterations
have taken place; but a track the whole way may still
be made out, though hidden in places by private drives
and occupation roads. From White Moss it dropped but
little at first, passing behind the highest of the modern
houses, according to the belief of old people, who say
that this section of it, though remembered, was stopped
up before their time. It touched How Head, a farmhold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
now deserted; then the Hollins, Forest Side, Ben Place
and Beck Houses. It crossed Greenhead Gill and passed
behind Knott Houses, Winterseeds and Gillside, continuing
by the present ford over Tongue Gill, whence the
pass is soon gained.</p>

<p>Now of these names many represented of old not one
house, but a couple or even a group. Doubtless most of
them were planted by the Norse settlers either upon or
below the Roman road, on some spot conveniently above
their meadows and common field; and devious lanes would
in time become trodden between one and another, to the
final discarding of the old straight track. Still this can be
traced in places; and a bit to be seen above Winterseeds
is probably the actual Roman road. A stone celt was
recently found in the beck close below it. A quern was
also found not far off.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The fact that a smithy existed
until recently at Winterseeds&mdash;which is only reached now
by climbing the steep brow from the main road&mdash;is strong
presumptive evidence of an old line of traffic passing by
it. There the last of the smiths, John Watson, made the
ironwork of the present outer church-door. When he
became old, a smithy was set up on the lower road, at
Tongue Gill.</p>

<p>Now it is a singular fact that a field lying a little below
this road, near the gateway of Forrest Side, bears the
name of Kirk How. And there is a tradition attached to
the spot. It is said that the church of the valley was to
have been built here, and that the materials were even
gathered together ready for the start; when lo! they
vanished in the night-time, only to be found upon the
present site, and that a second attempt only produced a
like result, the inference being conveyed, by sly looks and
chuckles on the part of the narrator, that the task had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
wrought by some supernatural Being, not to be lightly
mentioned. Whether this was the Hob, or Hobthrush
who played so large a part in the stories of the past,
cannot be said, but the legend, in its humorous fearlessness,
and love of a practical joke, is characteristic of the
dalesman,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and coupled with the name of the field it is
suggestive. It seems possible that here, at a spot where
a traveller upon the road might so conveniently halt and
set up his cross and portable altar, an early rude (perhaps
timbered) structure may actually have once stood. A
well, too, for baptism was not far off. There is one in the
grounds of the Hollins whose water has remained in repute,
and which was examined by an expert at the time (1843)
when an effort was made to establish a hydropathic cure
in Grasmere.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The water was then pronounced finer than
that of St. Oswald's Well; but as the owner of the land
would not sell, the establishment was placed at the Wray,
close to St. Oswald's. The enterprise, started by Mr.
Phillips, and conducted by a resident doctor and a German
bathman, was not successful, and was given up in five or
six years. If the well at the Hollins ever had a name, it
is now unknown.</p>

<p>It is hard not to let conjecture play round this tradition
of a change of site. Might it not actually have been
made? Could it be connected with the turning of Grasmere
into a manor, and with the parcelling out of a demesne
in the valley? The barons of Kendal, of whom Ivo de
Talbois was the first, possessed all these parts, from the
time of Henry I. He and his successors governed by
feudal methods, through agents. There was here no intermediary
lord between baron and vassal; and the baron's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
officers&mdash;his bailiffs and his foresters&mdash;would be placed in
secure houses or fenced lodges, whence they would control
and govern. A demesne of Grasmere is mentioned on
the death of William de Lindesay, 1233, and a manor
and park in a charter of 1297.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The woods sold by Henry
the Eighth in 1544 were the residue of the lord's forest;
he being the inheritor of the Fee.</p>

<p>Now we may reasonably suppose this demesne to have
been planted in Kirktown, as the present village came to
be called, where the meadows were rich and the soil deep
for ploughing, but distant from, and below the ancient
line of road with its scattered homesteads. The demesne
made a village nucleus; for all the accessories of a manor
house would spring up about it. We know the lord's
brewery was not far off, at Kelbergh, where springs&mdash;beside
the holy one&mdash;are still abundant.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> In a rental,
dated 1375<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> that concerned the part of Grasmere then
held by the Hotham and Pedwardyn families, it is stated
that "Richard Smyth holds the forge and should render
12d and 1d," with the addition that he pays 2s 0d per
annum for "Kelebergh." From another document we
learn that certain tenants of Grasmere pay an unspecified
sum for the brewery of Keldbergh.</p>

<p>This manorial centre was united to the high line of
road on the other side of the valley by several ways. One,
a footpath, still passes hard by Kirk How, a now disused
smithy being upon it. Two others approach and meet to
cross Raise Beck together by White Bridge, the name
indicative of a stone fabric at a time when timber was
commoner. Here the village pinfold still stands.</p>

<p>What more natural than that the church should be
added to this central group, and at a time perhaps when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
enlarged space and entire rebuilding of an existing edifice
required to be done? The site by the river would afford
deep soil for burial. To such a change of site (supposing
it were made) there would naturally be opposition from
some quarter; whence the tradition.</p>

<p>This, however, is but conjecture. The fabric of the
present church shows no feature that is of a certainty older
than the introduction of manorial rule into Grasmere;
while it may be as late as the fourteenth century. But
before considering the question of its age, it will be well
to point out other evidences of the existence of a church
in the valley before record began, and then pass on to
such scant records as time has left to us.</p>

<h2><a name="PARISH" id="PARISH">THE PARISH</a></h2>


<p>The church of Grasmere is found when record begins,
serving as the centre of a large and regularly constituted
parish. The date of the creation of this parish
is not known; but from the fact that its southern boundary
runs by the Stock Beck&mdash;thus cutting the now
thriving town of Ambleside into two parts, one of which
belonged to Grasmere and the other to Windermere&mdash;there
seems a probability of it having been delineated at
an early period, when the <em>sæter</em> of some Norse settler was
but an insignificant clearing in the forest.</p>

<p>Every parish is but a unit in a complex Church organization,
which passes upwards by rural deanery, archdeaconry,
to diocese. In historical evolution, there is
a descent from the greater to the less; while each successive
ecclesiastical demarcation followed as a rule some
political line of kingdom or state. The diocese for instance
was conterminous with the Anglo-Saxon kingdom; the
parish represented the township, or the manor.</p>

<p>But in the vast kingdom of Northumbria the superposition
of church boundaries upon state boundaries was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
not so simple a matter, and the subdivisions that took
place are not easy to trace. Archbishop Theodore, when
called in by King Egfrith (678) to portion his kingdom
for purposes of church rule, made at least three bishoprics
out of the one whose centre&mdash;after a removal to Lindisfarne&mdash;was
fixed at York.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Next, the archdeaconries were marked out under
Thomas, Archbishop of York, some time between 1070
and 1100. The archdeaconry of Richmondshire, lying in
the mountainous region west of the old Anglian kingdom,
was a great and peculiar province, and the archdeacon
ruled over it with almost the powers of a bishop.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>The archdeaconry was divided again into rural deaneries,
of which Kendal was one. This deanery embraced ten
parishes, Grasmere being the westermost of them. It
appears singular that this group of ten parishes lay in
three different counties,&mdash;Yorkshire, Lancashire, and
Westmorland; and from this circumstance it has been
argued that here (as in our own parish) the ecclesiastical
division was made prior to the political one of counties.
This probably was so; and it is clear that the deanery
represents in reality another political area, viz.: that of
the barony of Kendal created by William Rufus.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Kirkby Kendale, the <em>caput</em> of the barony, became from
this period the official church centre. There the Synods
and Archidiaconal Courts were held, and all dues were paid
which the higher church authorities exacted from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
parishes&mdash;Grasmere among them.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Thither the rector or
his substitute, along with the churchwardens, annually
repaired.</p>

<p>The exact relationship between the central church at
Kirkby and the churches of Grasmere and Windermere
in early days is hard to make out. They were considered
in some sort as dependencies, and were called chapels
after they had become parish churches. This uncertain
position recalls the constitution of the early British church.
And it must be remembered that Theodore's <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">parochia</i> was
not a parish but a diocese. Again, the laws of Edgar
(959-975) place churches in three classes: first, the ancient
church or monastery of a district; second, the church with
a corpse-ground; and third, the church without a corpse-ground.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
Tithes moreover were enjoined to be paid to
the ancient or central church.</p>

<p>Now Grasmere may at first have ranked in the third
order, as a mission church (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">capella</i>). It would in that
case pay its tithes, or a large proportion of them, to Kirkby
Kendal, and bury its christian dead within the consecrated
soil of that church. It may not have acquired the right
of burial until the lord created a demesne there.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> This
view is strengthened by the fact that the church of Kendale
claimed certain dues from Grasmere and Windermere down
to a late date. One was a pension of 13s. 4d. (one mark)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
paid to the vicar out of the tithes of the parish. The
other was a mortuary fee, exacted by him as late as the
seventeenth century.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<h2><a name="BOUNDARIES" id="BOUNDARIES"></a>BOUNDARIES</h2>


<p>The boundary of the parish of Grasmere followed
geographical lines. Starting from the point where
the Rothay and the Brathay unite for their entrance into
Windermere, it ascended the first river for a short distance
until it reached the tributary, Stock beck. This it ascended
until, near the source, it struck upwards to the line of
the watershed. It then followed a devious course along
the mountain tops, as "heven watter deales" (divides),
according to the quaint old boundary phrase. Always
clinging to the sky line between waters flowing north and
south, it dropped to Dunmail Raise, to rise to the tops
again. From these lonely heights it made another short
artificial course to reach Little Langdale beck near the
source, and with these waters&mdash;named Brathay after
emerging from Elterwater&mdash;it continued to the uniting
place of the two rivers at Bird-house Mouth. Thus, with
the exception of the right bank of the Brathay, the parish
embraced the whole area of the two valleys of the Rothay
and Brathay and their confluents. Its boundary marched
with that of parishes in Westmorland, Cumberland and
Lancashire. Its northern line was for centuries the boundary
between the Anglian rule, and the Celtic kingdom of
Cumbria. Its circuit counted some thirty-five miles by
flat measurement; but much of it lay on summits that
reach to a great height.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="TOWNSHIPS" id="TOWNSHIPS"></a>THE TOWNSHIPS</h2>


<p>This parish&mdash;a wild tract of fells, becks, and tarns,
was divided into three component parts.</p>

<p>It has been pointed out<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> that the ancient church of
Northumbria left certain marks upon the districts she
administered which may yet be distinguished. One
peculiarity was the great extent of the parishes, some of
which embraced several&mdash;occasionally many&mdash;townships.
Another was, that each parish was governed secularly by
a body of men known as the Twenty-four. Now Grasmere
conformed nearly, though not exactly, with these rules;
for the controlling body consisted of Eighteen, not Twenty-four,
being in this respect like the Cumbrian parish of
Crosthwaite to the north. But other parishes of the
district had their Twenty-four&mdash;as Cartmel and Dalton
in Furness.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> In the next parish of Windermere, the
Twenty-four are still an active body, and collect at the
church every Easter Tuesday, eight coming from each of
the three townships, Under-Milbeck, Applethwaite and
Troutbeck.</p>

<p>The parish of Grasmere also embraced three townships.
One was Grasmere proper, situated in the basin-shaped
vale that catches the sources of the Rothay, Langdale;
the sister valley formed the second township, which extended
to Elterwater; the third was Rydal-and-Loughrigg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
(often called Loughrigg and Beneath-Moss) which
included all the rocky mass between the converging rivers,
the compact village of Rydal with part of Ambleside.</p>

<p>From three sides of the parish then, by mountain path
and "horse-trod," the folk wended their way for worship
to Grasmere Church. Those of the vale of Grasmere
proper would gather in units or little groups from all the
scattered farmsteads, from Far Easdale and Blindtarn
Gill, from Town Head, Gill Side, and all the houses that
lay "Aboon Beck" as far as How Head and Town End,
till they met at their lych-gate on the north side of the
church.</p>

<p>From Loughrigg and Beneath-Moss they would collect
by many a devious track, starting as far back as Clappersgate
and Ambleside. From Ambleside ancient
"trods" passed Nook End, and rose from Scandale Bridge
by easy grade to Nab Lane (where Rydal folk would join
them) and White Moss, and thence descending to cross
the church bridge to enter the garth by the present gate,
which was specially their own.</p>

<p>The third stream of worshippers flowed from the
farthest sources west, from the recesses of Little Langdale,
from Blea Tarn, and Fell Foot, from Forge and Hackett
and Colwith they came, on through Elterwater, and across
Walthwaite Bottom. Mounting the brow, they would
meet a tributary stream of fellow-townsfolk, that gathered
right from Steel End and Wall End, increasing as it flowed
down Mickle Langdale, till it crossed the ridge of Hunting
Stile. Dropping steeply into the vale, they would at
Nichols (where stood an inn) meet a third contingent
(from Loughrigg) which, starting at Skelwith, mounted
by Foul Step to Little Loughrigg, passed by the Fold,
the Oaks and Scroggs, to descend by Red Bank to the
level of Grasmere Lake.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> From Nichols onward the united<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
groups would travel by the lake, and past the Holy Well,
to enter the church garth by a gate at the north-west
angle, now gone, called the Langdale gate.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Here, at
Church Stile, stood an important inn, long owned by the
Harrison family. Shelter and a fire must indeed have
been often needed (as well as something for the inner
man) after the long travel&mdash;especially at funeral gatherings,
when the corpse had to be borne through ford and
flood, or through the storms and deep snows of winter
time. The Ambleside folk, when in 1674 they petitioned
their bishop for the right of burial in their chapel, stated
that "by reason of the heat in summer and the great
snowes and sudden inundations of water in winter it is
very difficult and dangerous to carry their dead thither
[to Grasmere] for burial";<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> yet their distance from the
church was nothing like that of the Langdale folk. There
were not infrequent burials from the right bank of Little
Langdale beck, in the parish of Hawkshead or of "Ulverston."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Once within the churchyard, the different streams of
the townships mingled as fellow parishioners. The sexes
however, divided, the women seeking entrance (presumably)
by the great south porch, and the men (after
business done) herding in by the west door, known as
theirs. Yet once inside, they again fell rigorously into
ranks of townships, as we shall see.</p>

<p>The gathering of the dalesfolk for worship must have
been a striking sight, especially on the great feast days
when&mdash;four times in the year&mdash;the sacraments were administered.
Certainly attendance at church was obligatory
upon every Sabbath Day, and fines were levied
for default. But from the early seventeenth century, if
not before, the dependent chapels in Langdale (at Chapel
Stile) and Ambleside would absorb many of the more
distant worshippers. For the four great celebrations,
however, the whole of the adult population of the valleys,
except the sick and infirm, would attend the parish
church.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> It is of course impossible to compute the
number of the people, especially in early times; but if we
accept the statement made in the Presentment of 1712,
that there were then about 200 families in the parish, it
may be reckoned that at that time and for at least a
century previously, no fewer than from 500 to 700 communicants
would gather for the rite. Besides the master
and mistress of the homestead, there were grown-up sons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and daughters, with farm servants.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> The garth would
be crowded with the concourse of folk; and when they
trooped into the fane, each township to its own quarter
of the building, where men and women again divided to
take their accustomed places upon their separate forms,
and the dogs sneaked in, hoping to escape the dogwhipper's
eye as they settled under their masters' legs,
the whole space must have been packed.</p>

<p>The old, narrow close-set forms seated far more people
than the modern benches, but even they could not have
accommodated the crowds that attended certain funerals.
(See Charities.) At Mrs. Fleming's funeral, for instance,
few short of 2000 persons must have been present, including
dole-getters, neighbours and relatives.</p>

<h2><a name="SOME_LEGAL_ASPECTS_OF_THE_CHURCH" id="SOME_LEGAL_ASPECTS_OF_THE_CHURCH">SOME LEGAL ASPECTS OF THE CHURCH</a></h2>


<p>Thus for worship did the folk gather in the church.
They came thither also to bury their dead within
consecrated soil&mdash;for baptism of their "barnes" by the
priest, and the binding of man and woman in holy matrimony.
But the edifice and the enclosed space about it
served in early times not only for purposes of religion,
but of the law. Like the Roman Forum, it was used for
the transaction of public business and the administration
of justice. Bargains were ratified, covenants were witnessed,
and protestations made solemn by an oath taken
upon the Holy Gospel where it lay upon the altar&mdash;once
a wonderful script illuminated and jewelled, that is now
represented by the dirty little Testament of the Law
Courts. Manor Courts and legal enquiries or inquests
were frequently held within it. Public notices that concerned
the townships&mdash;private ones even of auctions and
the like&mdash;were proclaimed before the assembled people in
the garth or the porch, if not in the building itself. Punishments
for moral offences were carried out in face of
the congregation.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>
<p>The priests and the clergy acted as legal agents for the
unlettered folk till comparatively recent times. They
were versed in the intricacies of law, as well as ritual,
and skilled in penmanship and the Latin tongue. The
higher of them are found acting as agents and accountants
for the holders of the fees into which the barony became
split, as documents which concern our parish show.</p>

<p>Frequently the chaplain or the village priest drew up
indentures, petitions, and secular agreements for the
living, as well as the testaments of the dying. Wills
were proved at the church registry of the diocese, and
were stored there. The wills of the parish of Grasmere
went to the town of Richmond, the centre of the archdeaconry;
and not until 1719 were they proved at the
secular courts of Kendal and Lancaster.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Instances of the use of the church fabric for secular
purposes in the neighbourhood may be quoted. A Court
Roll of 1443 is headed "Court of Wynandremere held at
the church of Wynandremere 9 July 21 Henry VI."<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> An
award concerning a private dispute in 1534 between
George Browne of Troutbeck and Myles Dickson of Applethwaite
decrees that the former pay to the latter "upon
the secunde sonday in lente next comynge O-XLs of able
ynglyshe money upon or. layde Alter in Wyndandermer
church betwixe VIII of the clock and XII of the said
sonday."<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Again, an indenture made 1571 between Mr.
John Benson and his Baisbrowne tenants stipulates that
the payment of certain moneys should be made "in langdaill
chappell betweene thoures of eyght of the clock at
aftr. noine" on the 1st of August in the two ensuing
years.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> In 1601, when Widow Agnes Fleming of Rydal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Hall with her sons sued a Penrith man for debt, the
commissioners sat and examined witnesses in Ambleside
Chapel.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> And within this building were probably taken
down depositions in several other cases.</p>

<p>As regards Grasmere itself record is scant. The
manorial courts were occasionally held in the Moot Hall of
Kirkby Kendal, as in 1603,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> but in early times it would
be impossible to summon the holders from so far; and
it is stated in 1436 that two courts were yearly held in
Grasmere.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> No other building than the church could
have contained this official gathering. The judgment on
the 1583 tithe dispute enjoined that the parishioners were
to pay their tithe of lambs in money every Easter "in
the parish church of Gresmier." The church or chapel
was as a rule the schoolroom where the priest taught.</p>

<p>The churchyard, even more than the church itself, had
its secular and popular uses, which came down from
ancient time. The fairs, the markets, the sports and the
wrestlings<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> which took place within its enclosing walls,
and of which we obtain faint intimations, were but the
survival of the festivals sanctioned by the early church,
when the wake, or fair of the patron saint was kept.
This again, with its bull-baiting, its rude sports and its
temporary stalls, may be linked on to the earlier rites of
heathen times, when beasts were brought to the Temple
for sacrifice, and when the people built booths about it,
in which to hold a three days' feast. The annual or
biennial fair, and even the Sunday market, were quite
usual in the churchyard, before the boroughs obtained a
special privilege for them. And though an express
statute in 1285 forbade the practice, neither this nor the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
later injunction of the Church were heeded. In 1300 the
town of Cockermouth complained that its market was
spoilt by the bartering carried on at Crosthwaite Church,
where not only flesh and fish were sold at festivals (and
this distinctly smacks of an ancient sacrificial practice);
but that corn, linen, cloth and other commodities were
conveyed thither every Sunday for barter. In 1380 the
town of Appleby was suffering from a like cause. Merchants
were carrying their goods to sell in the churchyards
of the surrounding district on Sundays, to the detriment
of the accredited market.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> If this was done in other
places of the district, it was certainly done at Grasmere,
for the market town of Kendal was sixteen miles distant
on a road often impassable.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>It was not until the seventeenth century that markets
were established in the neighbouring towns of Hawkshead
and Ambleside, after Grasmere had in vain attempted to
secure the privilege.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>A good deal of informal business besides was conducted
in the churchyard, such as sales proposed or private
bargains struck. Of proclamations and sale notices made
within the church or garth we have abundant evidence;
and for these the clerk received generally a fee of 2d. No
doubt the "citation" we hear of for tithe wool due to
Squire John Fleming (1631) was made at the church. The
prohibition against cutting wood in Bainrigg (1768) which
the Rev. J. Wilson suggested should "be given at our
church of sunday" and which was to deprive the holder
of his winter fuel, has been preserved.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> In recent times,
according to Edward Wilson, the notices were given out
by the clerk in the yard, outside the so-called men's or
western door.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>
<p>The officers of the townships transacted business at
church; and the notices still hung in church porches are
a survival of the custom. The overseers of the poor
worked in fact in close connection with the wardens; and
the latter were responsible for some county rates which
are found entered in their accounts, such as (1708) "To
the Jaylor at Appleby" and "Prisoner Money." The
Overseers' books for Rydal and Loughrigg show that when
they failed to board a pauper within their township, they
paid to the clerk 2d. "for advertising her to let."</p>

<p>The constable (and there was one for each township)
had a far older connection with the parish church. He
caused meetings for his division to be proclaimed at the
church. Among the miscellaneous duties which he still
performed in late times was payment for the slaughter of
harmful beasts and birds. The heads of these were hung,
we are told, on the church gates as visible proof; and
Stockdale, writing in 1872,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> says that he has seen them
so exposed both at Cartmel and Hawkshead. The same
practice no doubt prevailed at Grasmere. The constable's
books for Rydal and Loughrigg record 4d. as the price
usually given for a raven's head, and 3s. 4d. for that of
a fox. In 1786, 5s. 0d. was paid "for one old Fox and
two young ones." Ravens were frequently entered, and
as the payments went to William Parke, we must suppose
them to have been taken on the precipice of Nab Scar.
Five were paid for in 1787, and twelve in 1790. These
would decorate the Rydal and Loughrigg gate. Two
foxes were paid for in 1793.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_EIGHTEEN" id="THE_EIGHTEEN">THE EIGHTEEN</a></h2>


<p>Not Twenty-four, but Eighteen represented the interests
of the townships in the parish church. This
was the case also at Crosthwaite in Cumberland, where
this ancient body of "sworn" men were swept away by
the Charity Commissioners at the time that they took
over the schools. Of the Eighteen in Grasmere six represented&mdash;along
with two wardens&mdash;each township. While
the wardens, who were all landholders, took office for one
year only, and in rotation, like all other officials of the
village communities, such as constable, overseer, surveyor
of roads, and frithman, the Eighteen appear to have been
freely elected, and they kept office for an indefinite
period.</p>

<p>The names of those who served the office at the Restoration
are given in the important document concerning
the fabric of the church printed later, and these names
were but slowly altered. In the churchwardens' books
of 1723 is written "Then chosen Edward Brockbank to
be an Eighteen man for Little Langdale in the place of
John Brockbank his father, deceased." Again in 1824
comes "Sides-Man Chosen by the Minister Churchwardens
and Sides-men," followed by their names. A list of these
was but infrequently written out, only an erasure marking
a change, as when in 1708 John Green, serving for Grasmere
"being Very Old and infirm, desired to be excused,"
and Thomas Green took his place.</p>

<p>The choice of a new member of the body lay apparently
with the Eighteen themselves, the wardens, and the
parson. This is still the case in Windermere, where (I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
am told) the choice of a new member of the Twenty-four
is discussed in full vestry, the clergyman, however, finally
nominating.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Yet the Eighteen were acting representatives
in church affairs of the folk of the townships. All
contracts for the improvement and alteration of the
church were made by them. They were responsible for
the share of their township in its upkeep, and laid a rate
on the landholders to cover the yearly expenses. It is
almost certain that the appointment of a clerk and schoolmaster
lay with them and the wardens, though the parson
no doubt sat at the conclave. We have no means of
knowing whether their powers extended further.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>It should be noted that the old name for them was
simply "The Eighteen." They are called Questmen in a
contract of 1687, but this appears to have been drawn
up by a stranger. The term Sidesmen occurs late, and
so does "The Twenty-four" which reckons the six
wardens, two for each township, in the number. Strictly,
the wardens (of whom there were eight in Cartmel) should
not be included.</p>

<p>The church constitution of Grasmere was therefore from
early times that of a parish controlled and administered
by a body of men representing the people, who
were responsible for the funds that maintained the building
and its services, while the clergy who officiated were
supported by the ancient system of the payment of
tithes.</p>

<p>The offering of pious folk of the tenth of their yearly
yield was at first intended to cover all expenses, but it
soon became diverted into purely ecclesiastical channels.
The tithe-paying parish indeed early excited the cupidity
of the least scrupulous members of Church and State.
Already in 1254 a rector of Grasmere is found to be
drawing the revenues of the parish without troubling to
serve it except by deputy; for the Pope in that year
granted a dispensation to Henry de Galdington, rector
of "Grossemer" in the diocese of York, to hold an
additional benefice with cure of souls.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> This is the first
record of the church discovered so far.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>
<p>The value of the rectory is stated in the dispensation
to be ten marks (£6 13s. 4d.). Estimates, however, varied
widely. About 1291 a taxation was made out for all
ecclesiastical benefices in England, the cause being Pope
Nicholas I.'s promise of the tenths which he claimed from
them, to Edward I. for a term of six years, towards the
expenses of a crusade. This great valuation remained the
standard of taxation until the time of Henry VIII. It
is said to have been completed for the Province of York
in 1292; and it sets down the "church of Gressemere"
in the Archdeaconry of Richmondshire as being worth
£16, and that of Wynandermere as £10.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>But the high valuation of 1292 did not hold good.
Complaints from the northern clergy that through impoverishment
by various causes, but chiefly the invasions
of the Scots, they were by no means able to pay so high
a tax, produced some amelioration. A correction was
made in 1318, when Windermere was written down at
£2 13s. 4d., and Grasmere at £3 6s. 8d., or five marks.
And at this figure it remained.</p>

<p>It stood indeed at five marks in 1283, when the first
mention of the church occurs in connection with the
secular lordship.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Editor's Note.</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The writing down of the value of the tithes of Grasmere was
the subject of correspondence between the author and myself,
and she writes: "The so called taxation of Pope Nicholas IV.
was acknowledged to be too high for the Northern Counties;
but the reduction of Grasmere, when the alteration was made
in 1318, from £16 to five marks (£3 6s. 8d.) is unaccountable to
me." It had stood at this figure previously but had been raised
to £16, and, as will be seen in the text, as early as 1301 in the
reign of Edward I., when the abbot of St. Mary's, York, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
allowed to appropriate "the chapels of Gresmer and Wynandermere,"
Gresmer is described as being worth £20. In 1344,
at the Archbishop's Visitation, it is described as worth 5 marks;
only to be again raised in 1435. In that year upon the death of
John, duke of Bedford and earl of Kendal, to whom they had
been granted by his father, Henry IV., we find among the items
of his property "the advowsons of Wynandermere and Gressemere
each of which is worth £20 yearly." After this the tithes
again reverted to 5 marks and in the reign of Henry VIII. the
"pension" paid to the abbey is put down as only half of that
sum, viz. £1 13s. 4d. at which it still remains.</p>

<p>The terms "pension" and "advowson" may not always mean
the same thing, thus advowson seems to be used sometimes as
synonymous with tithe. Hence Miss Armitt writes "The parish
churches, such as Kendal, Grasmere, etc., were "taxed" from
the twelfth century onward at a certain figure&mdash;ten marks (£6
13s. 4d.) £16 or £30. What did this taxation represent? The
absolute sum to be paid by the rector from the tithes to king,
pope, archdeacon, court, or feudal lord? or was it a valuation
only of the tithes, from which was calculated the amounts of the
various 'scots' or annual payments to ecclesiastical or temporal
authorities?" It seems not unlikely that the rise from £3 6s. 8d.
to £20 in the reign of Edward I. may be accounted for by the
fact that the "Old Valor" which was granted by authority of
Innocent the fourth to Henry III. in 1253 was superseded in 1291
by the "New Valor" granted to Edward I. by Nicholas IV., so
that when Henry IV. granted the chapels of Grasmere and Windermere
to his son John they were valued in 1435 at £20 each. They
were only being put back to the sum named in the "New Valor"
of 1291 which had been allowed in 1344 to drop to the 5 marks
at which they had stood in the "Old Valor." The tithe taxation
as established by the "New Valor" remained in force until Henry
VIII. But a "Nova Taxatio" which only affected part of the
province of York was commanded in 11 Edward II. (1317) on
account of the invasion of the Scots and other troubles. These
various taxings will account for the variation in payments which
were collected for the benefit of the king.</p></blockquote>

<h2><a name="PATRONS" id="PATRONS"></a>THE PATRONS</h2>


<p>William Rufus, upon his conquest of Carlisle, gave
over to Ivo de Tailbois all these parts as a fief.
After Ivo a confusion of tenure and administration prevails,
into which it is useless to enter. The line of patrons
of Grasmere may perhaps be begun safely with Gilbert
fitz Reinfred, who married Helwise, daughter and heiress
of William de Lancaster II., because it was he who first
held the Barony of Kendal in chief from Richard I., by
charter dated 1190.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>His son William, called de Lancaster III., died in 1246
without a direct heir; and the children of his sisters,
Helwise and Alice, shared the fief between them. It is
Alice's line that we have to follow. She married William
de Lindesey, and her son Walter took that portion of the
barony which was later known as the Richmond Fee, and
which included the advowson of our church.</p>

<p>Sir William de Lindesey, his son, was the next inheritor.
After his death, in 1283, a jury of true and tried men
declared that he had died possessed of "A certain chapel
there (Gresmer) taxed yearly at 66s 8d."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> The chapel
of Windermere, set down at a like sum, belonged to the
same lordship.</p>

<p>Christiana, William's heiress, was then only 16. She
was married to a Frenchman, Ingelram de Gynes, lord of
Coucy. There is evidence that they spent a considerable
part of their time in these parts, their seat being at Mourholm,
near Carnforth. Ingelram indeed fought in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Scottish wars, as did his son William. Christiana survived
her husband some ten years. They had at least
four sons, William, Ingelram, Baldwin, and Robert. It
was William who inherited the chief part of Christiana's
property in the barony of Kendal, which was declared
(1334) to include the manor of Wynandermere, and the
advowsons of the chapels of Wynandermere, Marieholm,
and Gressemere.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>The new tenant at once incurred King Edward III.'s
displeasure. His interests lay apparently in France,
where he resided, being styled lord of Coucy<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>; and without
waiting to do homage for his mother's English lands
and receiving them formally from the king's hands (as
was the feudal custom), he passed them over to his young
son William. The king pardoned the offence, and ratified
the grant,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> but he kept the youth, still a minor in 1339,
about his person,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and William's short life seems to have
been spent in service under the English banner.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>The family of de Gynes had a difficult part to play
during the wars that followed upon Edward's claim to
the throne of France. Their hereditary instincts carried
them naturally into the opposite camp, and they lost their
English possessions in consequence. On William's death
in 1343 the king&mdash;while he seems to have acknowledged
the claim of his brother Ingelram as his heir,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> kept the
heritage in his own hands. Moreover, he declared such
lands as were held by Robert de Gynes, a son of Christiana,
who was a cleric and Dean of Glasgow, to be forfeited,
because of Robert's adherence to his enemy,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> and for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
same reason lands at Thornton in Lonsdale held by Ingelram,
son of Ingelram and grandson of Christiana, were
likewise forfeited.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>The king presently used the escheated heritage to reward
a knight who had served him well in the Scottish wars.
John de Coupland had had the courage and address to
secure Robert Bruce as prisoner at the battle of Durham;
and Edward in 1347 granted to him and his wife for their
joint lives the Lindesey Fee which was the inheritance
of Ingelram. He excepted, however, from the grant
(along with the park and woodlands about Windermere)
the knight's fees and advowsons of churches belonging to
the same.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>The fortunes of war brought Ingelram, lord of Coucy,
and son of Ingelram, William's brother, as hostage for
John, king of France, to the court of Edward. There
he gained by his handsome person and knightly grace the
favour of the king, who granted him the lands of Westmorland
which had belonged to his great-grandmother
Christiana, created him Earl of Bedford, and gave him
in 1365 his daughter Isabella in marriage. Ingelram for
some time satisfied his martial instincts by fighting in the
wars of Italy and Alsace; but on the renewal of the
struggle between England and France, followed by the
death of his father-in-law in 1377, his scruples were at
an end. He renounced his allegiance to England, haughtily
returned the badge of the Order of the Garter, and
joined the side of Charles II.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>The Lindesey Fee was once more forfeited to the Crown.
Richard II. granted it, however, to Phillipa, daughter of
Ingelram and Isabella, and to her husband Robert de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Vere, earl of Oxford (1382); and when the latter was
outlawed by Parliament in 1388 it was confirmed to her.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
After her death (1411) she was declared to have been
seised of the advowson of the chapel of Grismere, taxed
at £10, and that of Wynandermere, taxed at 100s.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>Phillipa had no children. Henry IV. now granted the
Fee to his son, John, created duke of Bedford and earl of
Kendal. He died in 1435. His property in the barony
of Kendal included the "advowsons of Wynandermere and
of Gressemere, each of which is worth 20 li yearly."<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>The Duke of Bedford's widow, Jaquetta of Luxemburg,
received the third part of the Fee as her dower, with the
advowson "of the church in Gresmere." She married
Richard Woodville, created earl Rivers. After her death
she is said (1473) to have possessed "the advowson or
nomination of the church or chapel of Gressemere," though
in 1439 she had allowed her privilege to lapse.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>The Fee was next granted by Henry VI. (who inherited
it as heir to his uncle John) to John Beaufort, duke of
Somerset.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> The duke's daughter Margaret&mdash;afterwards
countess of Richmond&mdash;came into possession of it at his
death.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> After a lapse, when Yorkists sat on the throne,
and Sir William Parr of Kendal held it, the Fee (now
including the advowson of Grasmere) returned to Margaret
and passed to her grandson Henry VIII. He sold the
advowson and patronage of Grasmere. Its subsequent
history will be given later.</p>

<p>Such was the illustrious line of our church's early
patrons&mdash;some of them the most striking figures in a
chivalrous age. But it is not to be supposed that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
knew much of the little parish hidden amongst the mountains.
When the rectorate fell vacant, they would grant
the post to some suppliant clerk or priest, who would carry
their nomination to the higher ecclesiastical authorities.
The right to nominate often fell into the king's hands,
through minority of the heir, confiscation, or inheritance.
For instance, the king appointed to the rectory of Windermere
in 1282, in 1377 and in 1388. Edward III. nominated
Edmund de Ursewyk to "Gressemer" in 1349; and
Henry IV. did the same for Walter Hoton in 1401.</p>

<h2><a name="MONASTIC_CONTROL" id="MONASTIC_CONTROL"></a>MONASTIC CONTROL</h2>


<p>Our church of Grasmere was not left to the control
of parson and manorial lord like other tithe-yielding
parishes, it was snapped up by a big monastery. The
abbeys that had sprung up all over England in post-Norman
times were of a very different order from the
simple religious communities of Anglo-Saxon times; and
before long it became a question as to how they were to
be maintained on the splendid lines of their foundation.
By the reign of Henry I. they had begun to appropriate
rectories, and in 1212 the parish church of Crosthwaite
was given over to the control of Fountains Abbey in
Yorkshire, which carried off all the profits of the tithes,
merely restoring £5 a year to the rector, who was elected
by its chapter.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> St. Mary's Abbey had been founded in
York city in 1088, and its chapter found it necessary by
the end of the thirteenth century to look round the great
church province of Richmondshire to see if there were
no revenues which might by royal favour be appropriated.</p>

<p>In December, 1301, Edward I. despatched a writ to the
sheriff of Westmorland, bidding him inquire of true and
lawful men whether it would be to the damage of the
Crown or others if the abbey of St. Mary of York were
allowed to appropriate the church of Kirkeby in Kendale
with its chapels and appurtenances.</p>

<p>The inquisition was held, be it noted, not at Kendal
but at Appleby, where a sworn jury declared the appropriation
would damage no one. An explicit statement
was added which concerns us. "The chapels of the said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
church, to wit the chapels of Gresmer and Winandermere
are in the patronage of Lord Ingram de Gynes and Christian
his wife, by reason of the inheritance of the said
Christian, and they hold of the king in chief.... And
the chapel of Gresmer is worth yearly 20 li."<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>Accordingly a license was granted by Edward I., under
date February 23rd, 1302, for the Abbot and Convent of
St. Mary's, York, "towards the relief of their impoverished
condition," to appropriate the "church of Kirkeby in
Kendale, which is of their own patronage, in the diocese
of York, and consists of two portions, on condition that
they appropriate none of its chapels, if there are any."<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>The appropriation took effect; and moreover the Abbey
succeeded in gaining jurisdiction over the "chapels" of
Windermere and Grasmere. The nomination of the
rector indeed remained in the hands of the lord of the
Fee, but it was passed on to the chapter of the Abbey
for confirmation, before being finally ratified by the Archdeacon
of Richmondshire. Thus three august authorities
had to bestir themselves, when a fresh parson was needed
for our parish; and in 1349 King Edward III., the Abbot
of St. Mary and Archdeacon Henry de Walton were all
concerned in the business.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> No doubt the monks seized
the right to nominate whenever they could, and in 1439
George Plompton was named by them before his admission
by the archdeacon.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>This change was not put into effect, however, without
fierce opposition in the district. In 1309 an appeal went
up to the king from the Abbot of St. Mary, who styled
himself "parson of the church of Kirkeby in Kendale,"
wherein he stated that when his servants had gone to
carry in the tithe corn and hay, they had been assaulted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
by Walter de Strykeland and others; and moreover that
Roger, the vicar and the other chaplains and clerks appointed
to celebrate divine service in that church, hindered
them in the discharge of the same, trampled down and
consumed his corn and hay, and took away the horses
from his waggons and impounded them. Whereupon
three justices were appointed to adjudicate upon the
case.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>From this it would be seen that the local clergy were
as bitterly opposed to the monastic rule as the gentry and
the people. Sir Walter de Strickland with armed servants
at his command headed the opposition. His lands at
Sizergh lay to the south of the town of Kendal and he
refused to the men of the monastery right of way across
them for the collection of the tithes of corn, which was
always made while the stooks stood upright in the field.
After much wrangling, for no abbot was ever known to
withdraw a claim, articles of agreement were made out
between them, which reiterated the statement that the
church of Kirkby Kendal was "canonically possessed in
proper use" by the monastery.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> However, the convent
found it easier to let the tithes to the opponent, rather
than to wrestle with an obstructionist policy; and in 1334
Sir Walter is found agreeing to furnish to the monastic
granary now established at Kirkby Kendal three good
measures of oatmeal for the tithe of the sheaves of Sigredhergh,
sold to him by the abbot and convent.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>But the people were not appeased, and when in 1344
the archbishop made a visitation, opportunity was taken
to lay before him, in the name of "the common right,"
complaints against the monopoly of funds by the convent,
as the following document shows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Release of the Abbot and Convent of the Monastery of
St. Mary, York, concerning their churches, pensions, and
portions.</p></blockquote>



<p>In the name of God, Amen, Since we, William, by divine permission
Archbishop of York, ... in our progress of visitation
which we have lately performed in and of our diocese ... have
found that the religious men the Abbot and Convent of the
monastery of St. Mary, against the common right detain the
parish churches and chapels, portions, pensions, and parochial
tithes underwritten, namely, ... the annual pensions in the parts
of Richmond: of the church of Richmond 100s. and 20 lbs of
wax, ... of the vicarage of Kirkby Kendall £4, of the churches
of Gresmere and Winandermers 5 marks.... We have commanded
the said abbot and convent ... to show their rights
and titles before us and have caused them to be called, ... and
we ... having considered the rights and good faith of the said
religious men ... release the said abbot and convent ... as
canonical possessors of the said churches, chapels, portions,
pensions (&amp;c).... Dated at Cawood, on the 20th day of the
month of August in the year of our Lord MCCCXLIIIJ, and in
the third year of our pontificate.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The appeal had been made in vain. Yet opposition
could not have ceased, as the case was finally carried to
Rome. In 1396 a confirmation of the abbey's possessions
(including the chapels of Gresmere and Wynandremere,
worth 5 marks each) was made by the Pope, on petition
by the abbey, according to letters patent of Thomas
Arundel, late archbishop of York, dated November, 1392.<a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>



<h2><a name="CLERGY" id="CLERGY"></a>THE CLERGY</h2>


<p>Though not successful, Sir Walter de Strickland's
opposition had done some good, but for exactly
200 years longer did the monastery by the walls of the
city of York hold sway over the church of Grasmere. In
what degree its influence was felt in the mountain parish
cannot be told, or what it gave in return for the pension
it abstracted. It may have assisted in the rebuilding of
the edifice, lending aid by monastic skill in architecture.
Probably it supervised the worship in the church, and
improved the ritual, passing on to the village priest the
tradition of its own richly furnished sanctuary. Signs
were not wanting at the Reformation that the district had
been ecclesiastically well served.</p>

<p>It has been seen that the parson of the parish was a
pluralist and a non-resident as early as 1254; and so were
those of his successors of whom we have evidence. The
glimpses obtained through scant record disclose the tithe-taking
rector of the valley as a figure distinguished by
education, if not by family, and known to the lofty in
station. He is termed "Master," and bears the suffix
"clerk"; while "Sir" is reserved for the curate, his
deputy, who has not graduated at either university.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> He
was skilled in law more than in theology. He may have
served an apprenticeship in the great office of the Chancery;
sometimes men of his position are termed "king's
clerk."<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> He was not an idle man, and was often employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
in secular business by the lord of the Fee. It may
have been in the collection of the lady's dues&mdash;for the
heiress Christiana de Lindesay, had married Ingelram de
Gynes, of Coucy in France, in 1283&mdash;that the parson of
Grasmere suffered an assault (1290) at Leghton Gynes
(later Leighton Conyers). It is certain that when Robert
de Gynes, one of the sons of Christiana, and possessed of
some of her lands about Casterton and Levens, went
"beyond the seas" in 1334, he empowered Oliver de
Welle, parson of Grasmere, to act with Thomas de Bethum
as his attorney. Oliver de Welle had a footing in our
valleys besides his parsonage, for he is stated to have
held, under the lord William de Coucy, deceased, "a
certain place called Little Langedon in Stirkland Ketle,"
which was then (1352) in the custody of the executor of
his will, John de Crofte.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>Edmund de Ursewyk, "king's clerk," whom the king
nominated to Grasmere in 1349&mdash;the young lord William
de Coucy being dead&mdash;doubtless came of a Furness family,
and may have been related to Adam de Ursewyk who
held land for his life in the barony, by grant of the elder
William,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> as well as the office of chief forester of the park
at Troutbeck.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>"Magister George Plompton" was another learned
cleric of good family, being the son of Sir William Plumpton
of Plumpton, knight. He was a bachelor-at-law, and
was ordained sub-deacon in 1417. It was in 1438-9 that
he was nominated to the rectory of Grasmere, by the
Chapter of St. Mary's, and some years after he acquired
that of Bingham in Nottinghamshire. This he resigned
(and doubtless Grasmere also) in two or three years' time,
owing to age and infirmities. He retired to Bolton Abbey,
and in 1459 obtained leave from the Archbishop of York<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
to have service celebrated for himself and his servants
within the walls of the monastery&mdash;a permit which gives
a picture of affluent peace and piety in a few words.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>Master Hugh Ashton, parson, acted as Receiver-general
for the lands of the Countess of Richmond (the Lindesay
Fee) in 1505-6.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> On his resignation in 1511, Henry VIII.
exercised his right as inheritor of the Fee, and nominated
John Frost to the rectory; the abbot and convent presenting
in due form. This happened again in 1525, when
William Holgill was appointed.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Of other rectors of the post-Reformation period we
know little or nothing. Richard, "clericus," was taxed
in 1332 on goods worth £4, a sum higher by £1 than any
land-holding parishioner in the three townships.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><br />Curates</span></p>

<p>The curates who officiated under the rectors were a
different class of men. Constantly resident, and seemingly
holding the post for life, they belonged as a rule to
the district&mdash;even it might be, to the township&mdash;as did
William Jackson, who died 1569. A sharp boy, son of a
statesman, might attract the notice of the parson, or of
the visiting brother from St. Mary's Abbey. After
serving an apprenticeship, as attendant or acolyte within
the church, he might be passed on from the curate's
tuition&mdash;for the latter almost always taught school&mdash;to
Kendal or even to the abbey at York. On being admitted
into the order of priesthood, he would return to his native
place (should the post be vacant) and minister week by
week to the spiritual needs of his fellows and his kinsfolk.
Sometimes he even took up land to farm. Adam de
Ottelay, "chaplain," is set down in an undated rental
of the early fourteenth century, as joining in tenure with
John "del bancke."<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>
<p>The "chaplain" James Chamer, who witnessed a Grasmere
deed in 1486, was probably the curate there.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> It
must be remembered, however, that the three townships
appear to have been, from an early (but unknown) date,
furnished with resident curates, acting under rector and
abbot. Little Langdale too, if tradition be correct, had
its religious needs supplied by a chapel. It is possible,
indeed, that this may have been served through the priory
of Conishead in Furness, to which William de Lancaster
III.&mdash;the last baron to rule Kendal as a whole, who died
1246&mdash;granted a settlement or grange at Baisbrowne and
Elterwater, which was later called a manor. This grange
lay within Grasmere parish, as does the field below Bield,
where tradition asserts the chapel to have stood. The
first express mention of a chapel at Ambleside (within the
township of Rydal and Loughrigg) is found in a document
of Mr. G. Browne, dated 1584. But in the rental of
1505-6, William Wall, "chaplain," is entered as holding
in Ambleside one third of the "pasture of Brigges."
There is little doubt, therefore, that he was resident in
the town, and uniting husbandry with his clerical office.
Of a chapel in Great or Mickle Langdale the first evidence
that occurs (after the strong presumptive evidence of the
four priests serving the parish to be given immediately)
is the indenture of 1571, which expressly mentions it.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Start of the Reformation</span></p>

<p>The revolution which Henry VIII. brought about in the
ecclesiastical world of England shook our parish, as the
rest of England. Not content with the suppression and
spoliation of the lesser monasteries, he turned to the
greater ones, whose riches in gold and jewels, in land and
revenue, excited his cupidity. Remote Grasmere even,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
by diversion of the pension she had dutifully paid her
church superior, might supply something to the royal
pocket! So the new supreme Head of the Church is
found in 1543, bartering what he could to two of those
job-brokers of ecclesiastical property, who were so evil a
feature of the Reformation. The parchment at Rydal
Hall runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">A Breuiate of the Kings Grant of Gersmire</div>
<div class="line">Advowson to Bell &amp; Broksbye in 35<sup>to</sup> Hen. 8</div>
</div></div>

<p>Be it remembered that in the charter of our most illustrious
lord Henry the Eight, by the grace of God king of England,
France, and Ireland, defender of the faith, and on earth supreme
head of the English and Irish church, made to John Bell and
Robert Brokelsby within named, among other things it is thus
contained:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The king to all to whom, &amp;c. greeting. We do also give, for
the consideration aforesaid, and of our certain knowledge and
mere motion for us, our heirs and successors, do grant to the
aforesaid John Bell and Robert Brokelsbye, the advowson, donation,
denomination, presentation, free disposition, and right of
patronage of the Rectory of Gresmere in our county of Westmorland,
which, as parcel of the possessions and revenues of the late
Monastery of St. Mary near the wall of the City of York, or otherwise
or in any other manner or by any reason whatsoever, has
or have fallen, or may fall, into our hands. Witness the king at
Walden the twenty-first day of October in the thirty-fifth year
of our reign.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is clearly a copy of but a part of the original
charter, and the "consideration" which Henry received
does not transpire; but in the following month the two
speculators procured a licence to sell again, and they
passed over their purchase of the Grasmere advowson,
and of all woods upon the premises&mdash;meaning no doubt
the old demesne of the Lindesay Fee&mdash;to Alan Bellingham,
gent., for £30 11s. 5<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> d.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Bellingham in the same year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
purchased direct from the Crown that portion of Grasmere
known as the Lumley Fee&mdash;thus gaining the lordship of
some part of the valley.</p>

<p>Henry's sale of the advowson did not touch the tithes,
which were left in the hands of the rector; but he reserved
for himself the "pension" of 2<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> marks which had been
regularly paid out of them to the abbey. It passed down
with other Crown property to Charles II., and in his
reign was sold, according to an Act of Parliament which
was passed permitting the sale of such royal proceeds.
Since that time it has been in private hands, and bought
and sold in the money market like stocks. It may perhaps
be traced by sundry entries in account books, as paid by
the tithe-holder: in 1645, "for a pension for Gresmire
due at Mich: last" £1 13s. 4d. It was paid in 1729 by
Dr. Fleming as "Fee-farm Rent" to the Marquis of
Caermarthen; and later by Mr. Craike to the Duke of
Leeds; while Sir William Fleming, as owner of the tithes
of Windermere, paid the same from them.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> It is still paid
through a London agent, being officially set down as "Net
Rent for Grasmere, £1. 6s. 8d.: Land tax, 6s. 8d." This
sum represents&mdash;not five marks&mdash;but five nobles, or half-marks.
Thus it may be said that the dead hand of Henry
VIII. still controls the tithes of Grasmere.</p>

<p>This tyrant wrought other changes for Grasmere. When
creating the new diocese of Chester, he swept our parts
of Westmorland within it. The archdeaconry of Richmondshire
remained, but the archdeacon was shorn of
power. He no longer instituted our parson, as in the
days prior to the rule of St. Mary's Abbey, and this empty
form fell to the Bishop of Chester; who, on the death of
parson Holgill in 1548, appointed to the office one Gabriel
Croft, upon nomination by the patron.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>
<p>Now Croft was seemingly a man of unscrupulous temper.
The boy Edward was by this time upon the throne, and
spoliation of church revenues was, under his advisers and
in the name of Protestantism, the order of the day. The
parson of Grasmere was one of those who seized the
opportunity offered by the general misrule; and he committed
an act for which there could be no legal pretext.
Previous rectors had drawn the tithes of the parish, and
pocketed the large margin that remained, after the
stipends of the worthy curates who did their work had
been paid. But Croft went beyond this. In 1549 he
sold the tithes on a lease, and not for the period of his
life (which he might have claimed as his right) but for
ninety-seven years. The purchaser was his patron, Dame
Marion Bellingham of Helsington, widow; and she paid
him a lump sum of £58 11s. 5<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> d., upon the agreement
that she and her heirs would furnish from the tithes a
stipend for the rector of £18 11s. 7d.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>The bargain, ratified by John, Bishop of Chester, was
excellent for both parties; but it was disastrous for the
parish. So far, the tithes, however mismanaged, had
lain in the hands of the church and the clergy, for whose
support they were rendered. The Abbey of St. Mary,
while exacting a pension from them, exercised in return
a supervision that was doubtless of benefit; for under it,
the rector&mdash;though he took the bulk of them himself&mdash;could
hardly escape providing the three priests resident
within the parish with sufficient stipends. Moreover, as
he was an absentee, it is probable that he made a stable
arrangement for their ingetting, that would be convenient
to himself and comfortable for the parishioners (such as
obtained later), and that he even farmed them to the
dalesmen themselves. This method saved him the risks
of an annual tithing carried out by a paid agent, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
insured him a regular (if more moderate) income, in easily
transported silver money. The evidence of the lawsuits
shows that the system of paying a certain fixed sum instead
of the tenth in kind was actually in force for some commodities,
while in some cases this composition or prescription
extended to the whole of a landed estate.</p>

<p>The change was sharp, from church control to control
by a lay improprietor, whose simple business it was to
squeeze as large an income as he could out of his investment.
He was not likely to leave the tithing on the old
easy footing, nor was the parishioner inclined to increase
his offering without resistance. Squire William Fleming
was a big enough man to front on his own account the
common foe. Averring that, in satisfaction of all tithes
the customary annual sum of 20s. had been paid for "the
demeanes of Rydall," he refused Alan Bellingham's
demand for a tenth of hay, wool and lambs taken from
the yearly yield. Alan, who denied the custom, sued him
in the Consistory Court at York, including in his claim
the proceeds of the years 1569 to 1572, for which payment
had been made. The spiritual court judged in his favour;
whereupon Fleming carried the case to the civil court of
King's Bench. Here, after several adjournments, and a
trial before justices connected with the county, the final
verdict was given in his favour (1575).<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>Before the case was settled, the contenders struck a
bargain, and the ownership of the advowson of Grasmere
passed from Alan Bellingham of Fawcet Forrest, executor
of Marion Bellingham, to the Rydal squire for the sum of
£100, and that of the remainder of the lease of the rectory
and tithes for £500.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> The tenfold increase of the purchase
money in twenty-four years time shows the enormous
increase in tithe value when in the grasp of lay hands;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
for a rise of agricultural prosperity would not account for
it. Squire William now became in his turn the oppressor;
but the tale of the powerful opposition he roused in the
parish must be left to another chapter. The advowson
remains yet in his family.</p>

<p>To return to the parsons. Croft, with an annuity
assured to him, and a small capital in gold, no doubt
troubled himself little about his parish. He had defrauded
it and crippled its funds for the next hundred
years. The curates we suppose stuck to their posts,
though where their stipends came from is a problem.
Little change in ritual could have been made, before
Edward's death and Mary's accession brought a reinstitution
of the old form of faith, as well as a hopeless
attempt to restore stolen church property. In 1554 the
Bishop of Chester held a visitation at Kendal for these
parts, and the officials of the parish are set down in the
following list:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>It is clear from this that three curates then served the
parish&mdash;"Dominus" being the latinized "sir" of the
customary title. Of the third in the list evidence is found
in the parish register, where the burial is recorded on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
March 8th, 1577, of "Hugh Watson preist," this no doubt
being the correct form of his name. It seems likely that
he officiated in Ambleside, which by this time was a
thriving little town. Of John Hunter nothing further is
known: he may have served the chapel in Langdale.</p>

<p>From this will something may be gathered of the life
of the village priest who belongs to the vale, and whose
simple wish is to be buried by his two brothers within
the church. He has his appointed chamber in his master's
house&mdash;doubtless the rectory. His possessions are few.
There are some books, also parchment and wax, for the
making of wills and indentures; there is the mattress on
which he slept, and a great "chiste," in which no doubt
papers and clothes were stored together. Of clothes he
had a goodly stock, in jackets, gowns, tippets, caps, and
the stout leather doublet which no doubt he donned for
his long tramps through storm and rain and snow to the
dying. The sale of all these was to furnish money for
his legacies&mdash;for coin he had none. His benefactions are
characteristic: loyally to his parish church a noble, or
half a mark; to every servant of his master 12d.; to each
of his godchildren 6d.; and he desires besides that an
old debt, incurred in his "tyme of nede," should be paid
in new money. Some crisis is suggested here, when the
good wife of Under Helm collected money for him.</p>

<p>But other facts may be gathered from this will. Our
good curate bequeaths to "Sir Thomas Benson" his
sarsnet tippet, clearly from its superior stuff, the best that
he had. This, the usual outer dress of the priest, was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
long garment made with sleeves, reaching to the ankles,
and was tied with a girdle.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Now a Thomas Benson,
"curate," witnessed the will of John Benson of Baisbrowne
in 1563; he must then have served the chapel of
Langdale for a series of years. Also it seems probable
that the curate's master, John Benson, was the rector,
succeeding Croft or another.</p>

<p>A spirit of peace and goodwill breathes through this
document, and one too that suggests continuity in the
order of the church. Yet it must be remembered that it
was written in the reign of Elizabeth, when the Protestant
religion had been firmly established by law, and written
moreover by a man who had undoubtedly followed the
Catholic ritual fifteen years before. His fellow curate too
of that date, "preist" Watson, was still alive, surviving
him by eight years. There is a Protestant odour about
the cassock, and Jackson possessed one; but his wardrobe
is distinctly of the old-world, priestly type. It is probable
indeed that there was little change made for some time
even in the services of the church. The people of the
north-western mountains were conservative, and it was
they who most stoutly resisted the suppression of the
monasteries. There is evidence to show that the new
tenets were but slowly adopted in these parts. The
church at Crosthwaite was found as late as 1571 to be still
in possession of the furniture and pictures that had lent a
touch of splendour to the former ritual; and they were
then most stringently ordered to be destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>The people were not likely to welcome changes that
brought in their train not only impoverishment of service,
but reduction in the number of the clergy; for with the
diversion of the tithes, there ceased to be any provision
for the salaries of curates.</p>

<p>Langdale did without a curate, and not until over 200<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
years was the township once more blessed with a resident
minister, though the chapel was used for services. Ambleside
was in different case. Now a thriving little town,
equally distant from the two parish churches that claimed
it, with fulling mills bringing in wealth, it was able to
maintain a curate independently, and did so.</p>

<p>James Dugdale the cleric, who witnessed a Rydal deed
in 1575, might have been supposed to serve at Ambleside,
only that Priest Watson was then alive. Certain it is that
in 1584 the townsfolk placed their support of chapel and
curate on a solid basis, pledging each man his portion of
land thereto. This was immediately before the appointment
of John Bell as curate. The pledge was repeated in
a deed of the year 1597.</p>

<p>The rector of the parish, with no more than £18 odd as
stipend, had now to perform the entire duty of the wide
parish. Nothing is known of Croft's later dealings with
the rectorate, nor of Lancelot Levens, who followed him.
But on the latter's death in 1575, John Wilson was instituted,
and for fifty-two years he served as rector. From
his handwriting, seen in the market-deed, and from the
register (most negligently kept during his time of office)
an unfavourable impression is created. When he died in
1627, there followed&mdash;after a few months interlude, when
Robert Hogge served&mdash;the Rev. Henry Wilson, B.A., who
was to become notorious as a Royalist and High-Churchman.
He was nominated by Dame Agnes Fleming, the
clever widow of Squire William, who at this time ruled at
Rydal Hall for her son John.</p>

<p>The expenses of the tithe gathering were not great. An
item of 2s. 0d. is paid to David Harrison, the Rydal inn-keeper,
against "tythinge," and "for gathering tith Eggs"
1s. 0d. These last offerings were paid in kind, and we know
from subsequent accounts that this persuasive office was
somtimes filled by women, "two wiues," being paid in
1643 "for goeing 3 dayes gathering Eggs at Easter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>The later account-sheets kept by Richard Harrison show
less completely than Tyson's the income derived from the
tithes.</p>

<p>We have no entries discriminating between tithe and
demesne wool, which was now selling at a high price; nor
do we hear of the tithe corn, except that in 1643 the sum
of 10s. 0d. was paid for the hire of a barn for it. In Tyson's
accounts the even money received for it&mdash;as well as other
entries which connect its payment with the holder of
Padmire in Grasmere&mdash;give an appearance of it having
been then farmed, as it was at a later time.</p>

<h2><a name="CIVIL" id="CIVIL"></a>THE CIVIL WARS</h2>


<p>It is clear that the tithes were dropping in value; and
this is little to be wondered at when the condition of
the country is considered.</p>

<p>War was rife, and the "troubles" that affected every
household&mdash;high and low, either in actual fighting or in
tax-paying&mdash;were felt with peculiar poignancy at Rydal
Hall. Squire John Fleming, as a rich man, had not stooped
to conceal his religion, and had cheerfully paid his fine of
£50 a year as a Catholic of the old faith. He died on
February 27, 1643, at an unfortunate time for his young
children, when warfare was just beginning in the north-west.
He was buried the same evening, like many another
recusant, in Grasmere Church; and though Parson Henry
Wilson was paid a fee for "ouersight of his buriall" it is
possible that mass was first said over the body in the
"Chapel" chamber at Rydal; for one Salomon Benson,
a mysterious member of the group of papists gathered
about the Squire, in receipt of a pension of five marks a
year, was probably a priest.</p>

<p>The orphaned children&mdash;two girls growing to womanhood
and a younger boy&mdash;were now left with all the wealth
that would be eventually theirs, in charge of executors.
Chief among these was Richard Harrison, a nephew of the
Squire, and a Roman Catholic. He appears to have lived
with his wife and son at Rydal Hall, and to have had
entire management of the household in the years that
followed.</p>

<p>The position was a difficult one, and naturally grew
more so as time went on, and success began to attend the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Parliamentary party. The money-coffers of Squire John
were freely dipped into for loans to support the Royal
cause, which the young heir joined in person; and the
house was the resort of Royalist soldiers and gentlemen
of the neighbourhood. As a consequence, it was peculiarly
obnoxious to the supporters of the Parliament, and was
likewise detested by the Puritans as a hotbed of Papists.
Therefore, when the houses of Royalists were sacked up
and down the county, there was little probability that it
would escape.</p>

<p>A tradition has always existed that Rydal Hall was
entered and plundered by the soldiers of the Commonwealth;
but it is in the account-sheets of Richard Harrison
that explicit evidence of the fact has now, and for the first
time, been found. The catastrophe would belong wholly
to Rydal history, but for a clause in the accounts which
concerns Grasmere church.</p>

<p>Dates are difficult to follow in the sheets, but it is clear
that the year 1644 marked the turning-point of the war.
The hopes of the Royalists had been high when Prince
Rupert marched through Lancashire to meet the enemy;
but they were crushed by the terrible defeat of Marston
Moor on July 1st. The king's forces in these parts were
completely scattered, and there was a tremendous exodus
of loyalists, who left to join the king's army in the south.
The band was led by Sir Francis Howard, and it included
the young heir of Rydal. The exodus is marked in the
account-sheets by the numerous sums borrowed from the
Rydal chests by various people, beginning with the chief
himself. Even the loyal parsons borrowed, and small
sums were lent about this time to two of the Cumberland
curates, who possibly went off on king's business too.
Henry Wilson, the rector of Grasmere, was a noted
Royalist, and apparently acted as an emissary in the
cause. The following entry records one of the many loans
to him, at a time when he too was leaving the country:&mdash;</p>

<p>It is clear that in this year, 1644, the hall and its
inmates shared in the general sufferings. Friendly messengers
rode by night to give warning when another hall
was sacked. Hostile soldiers were quartered on the
premises, and some pillaging of horses and other things
was done, for which Harrison tried to obtain restitution.
He also sought protection&mdash;if it might be granted by wire-pulling
and bribery&mdash;from Colonels Bellingham and
Briggs, who commanded the Scots troops in Westmorland.
It is possible that the new glass required both for the
hall and for the choir of Grasmere church, "which was
broken," may have been the result of some hostile
demonstration.</p>

<p>But the actual raid upon the hall was made at Eastertide,
1645. The soldiers of "Captaine Orfer &amp; Collonell
Lawson" entered it, searched for money and took all
they could find (which was little) and carried off Richard
Harrison to prison, where he remained till Pentecost.</p>

<p>Further mischief is recorded in another paragraph of
the sheets, when the sum of £2 4s. 8d. is set down at
Easter, 1645, as "pd. for bread and wine twice at Gresmire
Church in regard it was once plundered by Lawson's
souldiers."</p>

<p>Now this provision for the Easter communion, which
the tithe-holder was bound to make, was a special provision,
always accounted for separately, and probably
delivered direct to the church from the wine merchant,
whose name is occasionally mentioned. So in this case,
the church itself was presumably entered with violence,
and by the same troop that visited Rydal Hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a Cumberland troop that did the mischief, as is
evident from the names of the officers. Colonel Wilfred
Lawson of the Isell family was an ardent fighter for the
Parliament. Captain Orfeur was doubtless a member of
the stock of Plumbland Hall.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>The troop may have marched from the siege of Carlisle
Castle, which had been held for the king through the
winter; and nothing is more likely than that, on their
march over the Raise, they would halt at Grasmere, and
do what despite they could to a sacred building held by
an episcopalian parson and a recusant patron, who were
of course odious for their so-called "delinquency." The
event, however, is inferred rather than actually stated in
Harrison's account.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>At Whitsuntide, on his release from prison, Richard
Harrison returned to his post at Rydal Hall as factotum
and financier. The position became steadily worse.
Young William Fleming had returned from Bristol, after
reverses in the south, only to be captured and imprisoned
in Kendal; and his freedom had to be procured by a
heavy ransom. In restless mood he declared his intention
of going overseas, and considerable sums were paid for
his fitting out; but he never got beyond London, where
he died shortly after of smallpox. The Parliamentary
Committee, then sitting at Kendal, exacted heavy fines
from the estate for delinquency. Oppressive taxes too
were repeatedly levied for the support of the Parliamentary
forces and the Scotch army. This extraordinary outflow
of money, as well as the loans made to friends, must have
materially reduced the wealth of Squire John, and have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
left less for the suitors who presently appeared to claim
the hands of the heiresses.</p>

<p>Not the Rydal estate alone, but the whole country-side
groaned under the burden of taxation. It is therefore
not surprising that from the hardness of the times, as
well as from possible illwill, the tithes began to yield an
uncertain return; and that to come by them at all it was
sometimes necessary to engage a strong man or a stout
party for the business. An item in the account-sheets
for 1645 runs:&mdash;</p>

<p>Adam Fisher was the Rydal blacksmith, and doubtless a strong man. Clearly no farmer could be found to take up a contract for the tithes of corn; and as we have seen, a barn had been hired for its housing.</p>

<p>In 1648 Harrison went into Cumberland, and spent a week getting the "tith-rents" due on St. Mark's Day; and he enters:&mdash;</p>

<p>Harrison was subjected to another imprisonment, and
squeezed by the hostile government of many further sums.
His account-sheets close in 1648-9, when the hall&mdash;soon
to lie under the ban of sequestration&mdash;was itself closed.</p>

<h2><a name="COMMONWEALTH" id="COMMONWEALTH"></a>THE COMMONWEALTH</h2>


<p>The year 1645 marked the beginning of a great change
in the church government of Grasmere. Already
the new system devised by the Presbyterian party (which
was now in the ascendant after the success of the Scotch
at Newcastle) was being put into force as a substitute for
episcopal rule. The division of the country into sections,
each called a <em>classis</em>&mdash;to be administered by a committee
of laymen empowered to nominate for each parish a
minister and four elders&mdash;was very rapidly carried out.
The following answer was sent to the Parliament's demand,
by letter from the Speaker, that <em>classes</em> for South Westmorland
should be formed:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>In the list of the parishes with their church officials
which accompany this servile epistle, ours appears thus:</p>

<p>The newly-elected elders were men of good position and
character. Mr. Brathwaite, son of Gawen, and grandson
of James, was soon to become the head of the Ambleside
Hall family. The Bensons were the descendants of the
rich clothiers of Elizabeth's days. Francis, living at his
freehold of the Fold, Loughrigg, was later to display his
indomitable will as a disciple of George Fox. Edward
Knott was one of a race of Grasmere statesmen whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
course was a forward one for some hundreds of years, and
whose later history belongs to Rydal and Coniston.</p>

<p>But before these men were chosen, or this letter written,
the "Committee" in Kendal had already interfered in
church matters in Grasmere, and had suspended the
parson. The Rev. Henry Wilson had served the king's
cause in other ways than by preaching; and it is probable
that the sums of money he began to borrow from 1643
from the Rydal Hall estate (whose coffers all the needy
Royalists had recourse to) were used upon journeys to
and fro as an emissary, or were expended in some other
way for the cause.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>By September he had borrowed £4 more, and on December
30th, £2 10s. But the Parliamentary party had by
this time determined to put a curb on the Royalist parson's
excursions. There exists among the MSS. of the Corporation
of Kendal, a bond, dated November 16th, 1644,
entered into by him to Colonel James Bellingham, "that
the said Henry Wilson shall appear and render his body
into the hands of the Provost Marshall of Kendall, at the
end of twenty dayes next after the date hereof, and in
the mean tyme shall not travell forth of the County of
Westmorland nor hold any intelligence nor send any

<p>Under the pressure of military force he was constrained
to appear before the Parliamentary tribune at Kendal;
and he must have been then formally inhibited from duty;
for the Rydal account-book shows:&mdash;</p>

<p>It is singular that in the Committee's report of its action
to the Parliament, in the letter already given, it makes
no mention of Mr. Benson's supersession of the rector.
It was not destined to stand however; and possibly there
was opposition in the parish. For Harrison enters, under
February, 1646:&mdash;</p>

<p>The remaining £4 was paid on May 22nd, "by order of
the Comittee." It would be interesting to know who
this server of the cure was. He had been resident since
at least 1641, when a child of his "Christe: Rawlinge,
cler," had been baptized. He had likewise joined Parson
Wilson in his bill three years earlier. His prefix "Sir,"
betokened him to be of the lower order of clergy, who
had not graduated at either University.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile Wilson, without stipend, was sinking under
a weight of debt. A year after the death of his first wife,
he had married (in 1639) Mrs. Dorothy Forrest, and he
had (besides a former family) young children born in 1642
and 1643. Harrison thought it necessary now, in 1645,
to obtain the consent of the young heir of Rydal, and of
another executor, before lending him further sums of
money:&mdash;</p>

<p>Possibly he left Grasmere for a time, yet it is clear that
he had hopes of recovering his position there. It is noteworthy
that the curates of St. John's and St. Bride's,
Cumberland, borrowed money about the same time, and
probably for the king's business likewise.</p>

<p>Parson Wilson&mdash;for so he was still called&mdash;borrowed £2
more in April, 1646, making in all £10, and £5 more in
May. This was done by consent of the executors of the
late Squire John Fleming, and he gave them a bill which
terminated on September 29th. He was quite incapable
of meeting such a bill, and it became necessary to devise
a plan for securing repayment.</p>

<p>Now steps upon the scene a figure destined to play for
long a prominent part in Grasmere church affairs. "My
Cozen Ambrose" is mentioned in Harrison's account-book
as ordering an additional 15s. to be paid to parson and
clerk on death of Squire John "for oversight of his buriall"
and now he took more pronounced action. He was nephew
of Squire John, whose sister Dorothy&mdash;his mother&mdash;had
married the lord of Lowick. He had been educated for
the church, and in 1629 was elected Fellow of St. John's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
College, Cambridge.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> From the first he was doubtless
intended to fill the post of rector of Grasmere, as the
patronage belonged to the family. Truly, the living for
the moment was worth no more than £18 11s. 7d., the
stipend paid by the tithe-holder; but Gabriel Croft's
lease of the tithes was to lapse in 1647, when they would
again belong to the rector. So when Wilson was found
to be in the last straits for money, John Ambrose came
forward (with the lease in view) to adjust matters. Under
date January, 1647, Harrison entered in his book:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>pd. to Mr. Wilson P'son of gresmire accordinge to articles made
betwixt Mr. Wm. and him by doctor Ambrose order for delapidations
for gresmire Rectorie and for confirmeinge all the tythes
of Rydall at 20s P' annm. duringe his life upon his agrement 24
mch 1646, and a bill 15 li lent money deliuered him in, and pd.
him this daie more to make up the Some to 22 li 10s, set down by
doctor Ambrose 7 li 10s 0d.</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus the broken-down parson was mercifully left in
his dilapidated house with his debt cleared, a few pounds
in hand, and the prospect of £1 yearly in lieu of the Rydal
demesne tithe, which was the ancient prescription.</p>

<p>Little as it was, it was better than nothing, and the
incoming of other tithes to the parson was problematic,
even if he were again allowed to serve the cure. But
this doubtful future he had not long to face. The church
register of that year records on June 26th "buryall
Henry Willson Clerk of Gresmyre."</p>

<p>There is scarcely a doubt that the Rev. John Ambrose
was at once nominated to the post by the Fleming family.
In evidence given for the Restoration lawsuit over the
tithes, it is stated that he had been inducted "about 15
years since," and had kept the office and officiated, till
ejected by "the late usurpers." The position with tithes
restored to it, was worth a struggle to keep, and the parish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
elders and the Presbyterian party at large would seem
to have offered no real opposition to this powerful
nominee.</p>

<p>That party indeed was losing ground all over England,
where a personal examination before administration of
the sacrament&mdash;rigidly enforced under the Scotch system
of eldership&mdash;was much disliked; and by 1649 its control
over church affairs was practically at an end.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>The successes of the Parliamentary army had besides,
after the victory of Naseby (1645), brought the Independents
into power. Without passing a law to annul the
Presbyterian scheme, they brought forward in Parliament
various fresh ones of their own; and in 1650 a bill was
framed for "the better propagating of the Gospel" in
Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmorland and Durham,
these counties having petitioned that the vexed question
of "settling ministers" might be finally resolved. The
Act was to hold good for three years; and after a slight
extension it was abandoned, as the Commissioners appointed
to carry it out had not given satisfaction. It
was while the Commissioners under the Act were in office,
and no doubt by them, that Ambrose, an episcopalian
and a Royalist, and nominated moreover by a family of
recusants, was ejected. In the depositions taken at
Ambleside, October, 1663, for the tithe lawsuit, John
Newton of Ambleside declared that the ejection took place
about Martinmas, 1653; and "John Wallace of Kendall
clerk," aged 32, gave evidence "that the complainant
Ambrosse, by some of the late usurped powers was
sequestered out of the parish church of Grasmere, sitting
at Newcastle on Tyne before 1653, after which this
deponent officiated in the said cure 1653, 4 and 5; and
after he left one John Tompson, clerk, officiated till complainant
was restored. During deponent's officiating most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
of the parishioners paid their tithes to him, and owned
him as patron; and he believes they did the like to
Thomson."<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>Wallas was clearly placed in the Rev. John Ambrose's
post by the Independents, who now&mdash;with John Archer
at their head&mdash;ruled the municipal and religious affairs
of Kendal, for the Parliament, by a strong-handed committee;
and that it was an ill-judged choice as well as an
ill-favoured one (at least by one section of the community)
is certain. By no religious party should John Wallas
have been considered a suitable pastor for the wide and
conservative parish, since he was either a man of low,
disorderly life, or unfortunate in making enemies who
could successfully libel him. In 1655 he was summoned
before the justices at the Quarter Sessions upon two
charges. One was the attempted ravishment of Clara
Barwis of Loughrigg, "a virgin" twenty-two years old,
and of this offence he was declared not guilty; while the
unhappy girl&mdash;likewise charged with "ye detestable sinne
of fornication with John Wallass Clke"&mdash;was by an
irrational and shameful verdict sentenced to three months
imprisonment for the joint offence. The other charge
against him was an assault upon one John Hird; but as
he brought a counter charge against Hird, this disturbance
of "ye publique peace" must have assumed the aspect
of a free fight.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>Wallas was not long to enjoy unchallenged his position
at Grasmere. The situation was being watched by one
who only awaited opportunity for action. It was a time
of unrest and seething thought; and in 1651 George Fox,
after beholding his vision of blood&mdash;when he ran through
the streets of Lichfield crying "Woe, woe"&mdash;had begun
his wandering life as a preacher. The country was swayed
to and fro by contending religious factions. The more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
sober and rational-minded among these, shocked by the
confusion that prevailed, formed themselves into "Voluntary
Associations," under which the acting church
authorities of each district&mdash;whether Independent or
Presbyterian&mdash;united for the purpose of settling (if this
were possible) the vexed questions of the administration
of the sacrament and the ordination of ministers. At
once an Association was formed for Cumberland and
Westmorland, where the success that attended George
Fox's first missionary journey through the distracted
counties in 1652-3, had brought consternation to all
sections of the Puritan party, and under the leadership
of Mr. Richard Gilpin it proceeded to action.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Meetings
for the settlement of church affairs were held every month
at Carlisle, Penrith and Cockermouth, and in 1656 the
counties put forth a joint manifesto, called "Articles of
Association."</p>

<p>It was the existence of this body with its moderate
and conciliatory policy, that doubtless enabled the new
squire of Rydal to take the step he had for some time
been preparing. Barely of age in 1654, and not yet in
possession of the family estates, he nevertheless&mdash;while
studying law in London&mdash;kept his eye on the condition
of affairs in Grasmere and sought how he might&mdash;if not
restore his kinsman Ambrose to the rectory&mdash;at least oust
the intruder. An entry in his accounts of 1s. paid on
May 24th "for ye Parrishioners of Gresmire their Caveat"
shows that he had secured the support of part of the
parish at least. Again on June 27th he paid 1s. 6d. "for
a cop. of the Refferees names concerning Wallas." Without
doubt he was preparing, even to the co-operation of
Mr. Brathwaite of Ambleside Hall, for the swift stroke of
ejection which was carried through on the eve of his own
entrance to Rydal by his faithful servant John Banks.
John communicated the result in the following letter:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>Good John, with the squire's authority at his back and
the co-operation of the Ambleside curate (a Presbyterian
no doubt), had successfully carried the situation through
for that day, but his spirit quailed before it, as did that
of the people. Under date February 18th he again wrote
to his absent master:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I should be glad to hear ffrom you iff you have heard anything
ffrom Oxford or London concerninge the P'sonage of Grasmire,
ffor wallas keepes the place still and saith he will doe it and that
he is instructed by Mr. Archer to keepe it til such tyme as he
present another, And he saith that he will cause Mr Turner to be
put off his place ffor goeing that one daye to officiate there, Sir
I desire that you will be pleased iff you heare anythinge to lett
me knowe that I may encourage the P'ishoners ffor the are nowe
more dismayed then the were beffore.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>In a postscript he reverts to the subject:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sir it will not be amisse to remynd them aboue (probably meaning
any grandee with whom young Daniel might come into contact
during his honeymoon visits) concerning Grasmire ffor it is the
Generall oppinion off all heare that Mr. Archer will doe you a
preiudice in it iff he can.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Archer was of course disputing the right of the
Rydal squire to nominate. But he and the Independents
were yet to learn the indomitable nature of the will that
now opposed theirs. The young squire, too wise to
attempt the reinstating of his kinsman, and assuming
the right to nominate, appointed one John Thompson to
the rectory: and he won his way in spite of obstacles
placed in it.</p>

<p>John Banks, then doing business in London, wrote in
perplexity on October 23rd, saying that counsel's opinion
was talked of in connection with the matter. Thompson,
however, kept his post. He may have acted in tune with
the Presbyterians for the time being, but at the Restoration
he returned at once to the uses of the re-established
Church of England. At the Quarter Sessions held at
Kendal, September, 1660, William Willson of Langdale
was charged with "disquietinge, abuseinge, &amp; disturbinge
John Tompson Clerk vicar of Gressmire in readinge ye
booke of comon prayer or service of ye Church &amp; in his
collaton or preachinge at Langdale Chappell" on the 26th,
"beinge ye lord's day" and the said Willson, refusing to
submit or to swear the oath of allegiance, was committed
to gaol, with the option of a fine of 100 marks.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Willson
indeed was a Quaker or Friend, who abjured all oaths&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
fact at first misunderstood, and which so frequently
caused their committal on political grounds. He was one
of George Fox's most fiery adherents, and a speaker among
the little band that had sprung up in the parish during
the anarchy; and in denouncing the clergy on their own
ground (the "steeple-house") he did but imitate his
master.</p>

<p>On the other hand John Wallas&mdash;who had apparently
been appointed by his friends to another church&mdash;was
charged before the Justices with not reading the Book of
Common Prayer, as ordained by law. His next appearance
at court, in 1663, was in connection with the plot
against the king and government, lately discovered. He
was suspected of being mixed up in it, and was committed
to Appleby gaol for three months.</p>

<p>The young squire of Rydal, Daniel Fleming, had now
a free hand in the congenial task of setting the church
of Grasmere on the old footing. There was some delay
or uncertainty, however, in the return of his cousin Ambrose
to the rectory. The church register contains a note
of money collected, August 25th, 1661, and this is signed
by John Brathwaite, "Rector of Grasmere," by John
Browk, "curate," and the churchwardens; and John
Browk's signature as curate occurs again August 7th,
1663. But it is certain that Parson Ambrose soon made
good his claim to the position of rector, and that John
Brathwaite remained as his principal curate in charge.
He was a man who had seemingly no mind for strife or
commotion. He showed supineness in allowing the squire
to conduct the dispute about the tithes which now arose;
as well as later to oppose the scheme of the Ambleside
folk to secure the privileges of baptism and burial for
their chapel. On this occasion the excuse was made of
his being then (1674) in residence as Fellow of St. John's,
Cambridge.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> Perhaps he loved too well the cloistered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
ease of the University. He never attempted to reside at
the rectory, and would seem to have arranged for bachelor
quarters to be fitted up at the hall, where he might spend
such time as he thought it necessary to devote to the
parish. These entries occur in the great account book:&mdash;</p>

<p>Such peaceful hours of card-playing&mdash;restricted to the

<p>For the recovery of the tithes, the rector relied entirely
on the legal knowledge and acute judgment of his relative;
and the draft of the Bill presented in the Court of Exchequer,
and now lying at Rydal Hall, is in the latter's
handwriting. From this we learn that certain parishioners
refused to pay tithes to the newly-instituted rector,
and that their refusal was moreover of some years standing,
as neither Wallas nor Thompson had been in a position
to compel payment from the refractory. There are
twenty-one names cited in the bill. Many of these were
no doubt conscientious objectors, though some would be
of that ever-present class, who seize any excuse for shirking
an obligation. From the wording of the petition, that
the objectors "pretended" John Ambrose never was
parson of Grasmere, nor had been lawfully restored, it
looks as if there had been some opposition to the squire's
change of minister at the Restoration. Mr. Thomas
Brathwaite had assisted him as we have seen in the removal
of the Independent, but now the expulsion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
(probable) Presbyterian minister in favour of the Episcopalian
roused the ire no doubt of the Presbyterian party,
headed by the Ambleside Hall family. Robert Brathwaite,
gentleman, was younger brother of Thomas, and
had inherited from his father Gawen not only the property
of High House, Hugill (where he generally resided) but
the small "manor" of Baisbrowne in Langdale. It was
on this estate that tithes were claimed from its owner,
who heads the list of recalcitrant parishioners. Another
prominent statesman among them was Christopher Nicholson,
of Padmire, Grasmere, of whose religious persuasion
we know nothing. A third was Francis Benson, freeholder;
he, along with Mr. Brathwaite and Michael
Benson, had served as an elder on the Presbyterian <em>Classis</em>,
and had now become an ardent Quaker. These, with the
rest, had&mdash;so the petition declared&mdash;combined to resist
payment, and had persuaded others to do the like. Their
position was certainly weakened by the fact that they
had failed to pay these customary dues for its support,
while they were satisfied with the ministry; yet the
demand now made for fourteen years' arrears, may well
have irritated them. The claim upon Mr. Robert Brathwaite's
estate stands thus, when placed in the form of a
table:&mdash;</p>

<p>The demand made upon each of the foremost defendants
in the lawsuit was exactly the same, showing that the
estimate of the tithes was a purely conventional one. It
amounted then for each prosperous statesman to £3 14s.
10d.&mdash;a large sum compared with the commutation of the
Rydal Hall tithe; and when this figure is multiplied by
fourteen for arrears, a total of £52 7s. 8d. is reached, which
was likely enough to arouse dismay and opposition. The
case dragged on; and on October 20th, 1663, a commission
sat at Ambleside, when witnesses were called on both sides.
The smaller statesmen were no longer cited, while Robert
Brathwaite, Christopher Nicholson, Francis Benson, and
John Benson stood as the defendants.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> The verdict is
not known; but payment of tithes once more became
customary. The refusal of the Quakers to pay the church
rate will be noticed hereafter.</p>

<p>The tithes seem often to have been let on lease, which
saved the rector the trouble and annoyance of collection.
Edward Benson of Loughrigg declared, in 1663, before
the commission, that he and Miles Mackereth and John
Brathwaite held a lease of them from Parson Ambrose for
three years, which ended April 15th, 1665. About the
year 1726 they were apparently farmed by the statesmen
jointly. A paper exists<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> entitled "Grasmere Tyth Corn
lett to the Inhabitants Anno 1726. Some wanting." It
contains the names of 55 landholders, with the amount&mdash;varying
from 1s. to 18s.&mdash;paid by each as an equivalent
for the tithe of corn. The total is £18 6s.</p>

<p>This agrees with the statement of Miss Craik, who in
1752 was corresponding with Sir William Fleming on
behalf of her incapable brother, the rector. While expressing
her surprise that he should think of renting the
tithes of corn, she tells him that Mr. Craik's collector had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
been persuaded to grant a three years' lease at £14 10s.,
which was too little. The salary of the collector, she adds,
had been in a former year £5.</p>

<p>The growth of corn increased seemingly in this district
as the eighteenth century went by, owing no doubt to its
heightened price throughout the kingdom. The tithe of
it accordingly went up in value, while wool, from the
decay of the cloth trade, went down.</p>

<h2><a name="FABRIC" id="FABRIC"></a>THE FABRIC</h2>


<p>Grasmere Church, as it stands at present, is itself
the sole guide we have to its age and the method
of its building. No document exists, prior to the Restoration,
that concerns the fabric. It was then apparently
the same as it is now. As one steps within the portal,
and sees through the gloom its strange double nave, the
rude spaces broken through the thick intersecting wall,
and the massive, split, misshapen timbers that support
its roof, one wonders who were its planners and builders.
Here surely in this strange and original structure we see
a work conceived and carried out by the very men who
worshipped within it. Sturdy, strong, and self-dependent,
they would seem to have asked little or no aid either in
money or skill, for the rearing and decoration of their
church. Yet its builders, when they came to remodel,
if not to rebuild their ancient place of worship, must have
known edifices of statelier plan. There was Kendal,
their great centre, with a church that must always have
kept abreast of the time in architectural beauty, and
which&mdash;from the earliest fifteenth century at least, showed
the dressed columns of stone, the soaring arches, and
chantried aisles which yet remain. St. Martin's of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Windermere, too, in the next parish, possessed a duly
proportioned nave, chancel, and aisle; and the columns&mdash;built
though they were of undressed stone&mdash;rose to
support a clerestory and the evenly-timbered roof.
Hawkshead again (whither the dalesmen often repaired
to market or fair) owned a church that was ruder than
the others, indeed&mdash;since its huge cylindrical piers support
circular arches, and the timber of its roof is rough-hewn&mdash;but
had a well-proportioned plan for nave and aisles.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 267px;"><a name="WINDOW" id="WINDOW"></a>

</div>

<p>These places, it is true, had advantages over Grasmere.
Kendal was in contact with the great world and with
the heads of the church, who visited it regularly. It
had, besides, access to freestone. Windermere, like
Hawkshead, had to let the intractable slate of the neighbouring
mountains suffice for the main structure: hence
the great piers without capitals and the plaster finish of
their interiors. But Windermere had an advantage in
its nearness to Kendal; and Hawkshead in its association
with the abbey of Furness, which was easily accessible
from there. Grasmere, on the other hand, was probably
ignorant of the beauties of the Abbey Church of St.
Mary's at York, to which it was attached. The church
was practically shut up within the remotest chamber of
the mountains, and could only be reached by 17 miles of
bad road from Kendal, over which no wheels could travel.
But with no freestone near, with only the hard mountain
slate to rive, or the boulders of the beck to gather;
without traditional skill and with very little hard cash,
our builders of Grasmere proceeded&mdash;when need came&mdash;to
alter and enlarge their House of God by such simple
methods as house and barn "raising" had made familiar
to them. Thus we read the story of the structure as
it stands at present, and see that the builders had clearly
little help from the outer world. We see, too, that this
structure was an alteration of an earlier one; which
was not itself the first, for the first stone fane probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">&nbsp;</a><br /><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">&nbsp;</a><br /><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
replaced a wooden one, either here or on Kirk How. It
was doubtless of that simple oblong form, without chancel
or tower, which was technically known as a chapel,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
and of which specimens have remained among the
mountains to this day. But an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ecclesia parochia</i>, possessed
of daughter chapels, could not be permitted by the
higher powers&mdash;whether of church or manor&mdash;to retain
so lowly a form. The manorial lords may have interested
themselves in its reconstruction, though there is no
evidence of the fact. In any case, it is likely that the
Abbey of St. Mary would take the necessary steps to
bring it up to the requirements of its position, and of
the worship to be conducted within its walls. The
visiting brother would carry accounts of the remote
little church to York; and a monk skilled in architecture
could be brought over to plan a new building, and to
direct its construction. The customary model for a
small parochial church would be adopted, which allowed
a chancel for priests officiating at the mass; then a nave
without aisles for the worshippers, lighted by narrow
windows&mdash;for before glazing was possible the opening
had to be guarded from weather by wooden shutters&mdash;and
to the west a tower, in which to hang the bells that
should call the parishioners from far.</p>

<p>Such doubtless was the existing church in its first
state, and of it there may remain the tower, the porch,
the south wall, and one window. There are indications
that before its enlargement it was more ornate then now.
Freestone was used, though sparingly, to emphasize the
chief architectural points. The opening into the tower,
piercing four feet of solid wall, has a moulding of freestone
(now battered away) to mark the spring of its slightly-pointed
arch; while a string-moulding is discernible
in the north wall of the nave, which may once have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
accentuated the window heads. The windows&mdash;if we
may suppose the one left between porch and tower to
be a relic of the original set<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>&mdash;were simple openings
finished by an "ogee" arch. The font may be as old as
the window, if not older. Its mouldings, which originally
followed the rim and divided the bowl into a hexagon,
are almost obliterated; and though no doubt it suffered
during the Commonwealth, when it was degraded from
its sacred use, the damage may not be wholly due to that
cause. The freestone used in the building was unfortunately
friable, and must have suffered at every alteration&mdash;such
as the piercing of the north wall by arches,
and the building up of the
tower-arch for a vestry. It
could not be replaced by the
remodellers; and they seem to
have intentionally chipped and
levelled it, and then freely
whitewashed it over, with a
general view to tidiness. They
even went beyond this; for
when the east wall was reconstructed
in 1851, a stone carved
with the likeness of a face was
found built into it. This is
now in the Kendal Museum.
The piscina, too, now refixed
(and, unfortunately, redressed), was found, covered
with plaster, lower down in the same wall.</p>

<p>The worn, maltreated freestone might, if we knew its
origin, tell something of the tale of the building. A well-squared
yellow block, recently laid bare in the porch,
is certainly not the red sandstone of Furness.</p>

<p>Now should the age of the fabric, decorated thus
simply though judiciously, be questioned, it must be
owned that there is nothing to indicate its being older
than the fourteenth century. It is true that a western
tower with no entrance from outside was a feature of
many Saxon churches, but such towers continued to be
built for parish churches until a late date. The rough
masonry of the Grasmere tower is due to the material;
and the massive boulders used in the foundation were
no doubt gathered from the beck, whose proximity must
have been highly convenient for builders who were poorly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
equipped for the quarrying of their slate rock. The
"ogee" or trefoiled arch was a development of the
Decorated style of architecture, which evolved the form
from the elaborate traceries of its windows.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> The Decorated
style is roughly computated as lasting from the
open to the close of the fourteenth century, and the period
of its use coincides fairly with the time when our church
fell under the influence of the monastery.</p>

<p>A church of primitive size would be sufficient for the
folk of the three townships, while they lived in scattered
homesteads and were all bent upon husbandry, with
short intervals of warfare with the Scots. But it would
become too small for a growing population that throve
in times of peace upon the wool trade.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> With walk-mills
in the valleys, and families growing rich as clothiers,
some extension of the church would be necessary; and
this extension seems to have been started in a fashion
strangely simple. Leaving the walls of the edifice intact
with its roof, a space almost equal&mdash;for it is but one
yard narrower&mdash;was marked off on the northern side,
enclosed by walls and roofed over. The intervening
wall could not be removed, because the builders were
incapable of spanning the double space by a single roof.
It was therefore left to sustain the timbers of the two
roofs, and through its thickness (over three feet) spaces
were broken in the form of simple arches. Thus&mdash;though
one is called an aisle&mdash;two naves were practically formed,
separated by the pierced wall. The date of this enlargement
is uncertain. If we place it in the era of the prosperity
of the townships from the cloth trade, it could
have been done no earlier than the reign of Henry the
Seventh, and no later than the early days of Elizabeth;
while a supposition that it was not taken in hand until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
the dissolution of the monastery had thrown the men of
the three townships on their resources is strengthened
by the character of the work.</p>

<p>How long the enlarged church remained under a double
roof cannot be said. Trouble would be sure to come
from the long, deep valley, where snow would lodge and
drip slowly inside. Clearly there was urgent need for
action and radical alteration when the powerful Mr.
John Benson, of Baisbrowne, made his will in 1562. A
clause of this runs: "Also I giue and bequeath towardes
the Reparacions of the church of gresmyre XXs so that
the Roofe be taken down and maide oop againe."</p>

<p>But how to construct a single roof over the double
space? This insoluble problem (to them) was met by
the village genius in a singular manner. The arched
midwall was not abolished. It was carried higher by
means of a second tier of arches whose columns rest
strangely on the crowns of the lower. These upper
openings permit the principal timbers to rest in their
old position, while the higher timbers are supported
by the abruptly ending wall. Thus a single pitched roof
outside is attained, sustained by a double framework
within. The result is unique, and remains as a monument
of the courage, resource, and devotion to their
church of our mountain dalesmen.</p>

<h2><a name="FURNITURE" id="FURNITURE"></a>THE FURNITURE</h2>


<p>Of early furniture there is, of course, no trace within
the church. All the accessories of the ritual of the
mass, whether in metal, wood, or textile, as well as such
as would be required for processions on Rogation Days,
were swept away at the Reformation. A reminder of
these processions may perhaps be found in the field at
the meeting of the roads near the present cemetery,
which goes by the name of Great Cross, for here, doubtless,
a Station of the Cross stood where the priest and the
moving throng would halt and turn. Another field is
named Little Cross.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 87px;"><a name="BENCH" id="BENCH"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Date on Bench End</p></div>
</div>

<p>One upright piece of oak, roughly cut with the date
1635, remains to show us the style of
the old benches&mdash;or forms as they were
called&mdash;which filled the space above the
earthen floor. The bench itself, to judge
by the aperture left in this end-piece,
would appear to have been no more than
six inches wide, and almost as thick;
the bench-end, which was further steadied by a slighter
bar below, was sunk into the ground.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 176px;"><a name="END" id="END"></a>
<img src="images/i_124.jpg" width="176" height="400" alt="bench end" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">BENCH END.</p></div>
</div>

<p>These benches could not have been fixed with any
permanence, for the earthen floor was often broken up
for the burial of parishioners. The custom of burial
inside the church was a favourite one, and was continued
down to the nineteenth century. While the choir was
reserved for the knight or gentleman (and of the former
there were none within the parish) and for the priest,
the statesman was buried in the nave or aisle; and only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the landless man or cottar would be laid in the garth
outside. Frequently in wills the testator expressed his
wish to be buried as near as possible to a deceased relative,
or the place where he had worshipped. He was in any
case buried within the limits of his township's division
in the church. In 1563 Mr. John Benson, of Baisbrowne,
who was a freeholder and probably a cloth merchant,
desired to be buried "in the queare in the parish church
of gresmire as neare where my
wife lyethe as convenientlye
may be." After the Fleming
family of Rydal and Coniston
became possessed of the advowson,
they were many of them&mdash;beginning
with William the purchaser
in 1600&mdash;buried within
the choir; though no monument
or tablet exists prior to
the one commemorating Sir
Daniel's father, 1653. The
tithe-paper shows the rate of
payment for interment in the
higher or lower choir. Besides
fees paid to the officials of the
church, the townships, through
their individual wardens, took
payment for all "ground
broken," as the phrase went,
within their division, and the
receipts from this source appear
regularly in their accounts. The usual fee for an adult
was 3s. 4d. (a quarter mark), and out of this 2d. had to
be paid by the wardens for laying the flag. Less was
charged for children, while women who died in childbirth
were buried for nothing but the actual cost of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
flag-laying. Under the year 1693, when seven parishioners
were laid within the church soil, we read "&amp; more for
the burying of two Women yt. dyed in Childbed in the
Church00li 00s 04d." There were seven burials in 1723,
five in 1732, five in 1766, and four in 1773. As late as
1821 Rydal and Loughrigg buried one inhabitant in the
church, and Langdale three. It is singular that the
Grasmere township discontinued the custom before the
two others, for no interment took place in her division
after 1797.</p>

show how frequently the floor of the church was disturbed
and levelled:&mdash;</p>

<p>The soil beneath the church is thus literally sown with
bones, and the wonder is that room could be found for
so many. But in this connection it must be remembered
that the practice of burying without coffins was the
usual one until a comparatively recent period.</p>

<p>No wonder that plague broke out again and again,
that the fragrant rush was needed for other purpose
than warmth, and that fires within the church could
not have been tolerated.</p>

<p>The custom concerning these forms or <em>ferms</em>, as locally
pronounced, was rigid. Every man had a right, as
townsman or member of a <em>vill</em>, to a recognized seat
within the church, which was obtained through the
officials of his township. This seat was, of course,
within the division of his township. The women sat
apart from the men, and even the maids from the old
wives. So tenaciously was the hereditary seat clung
to, that reference to it may occasionally be met with
in a will.<a name="FNanchor_128_129" id="FNanchor_128_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_129" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>
<p>Some serious alteration in the allotment of seats was
probably made in 1676, judging from these entries in the
wardens' accounts.</p>

<p>The Squire of Rydal, as soon as the Restoration permitted
it, set to work to furnish that part of the church in
which he worshipped suitably to the honour and dignity
of his family. The family seats had before his time
long stood vacant, even if they had been ever regularly
used. His predecessor, John, as an avowed Roman
Catholic, had preferred to pay heavy fines rather than
obey the law in the matter of attendance at the Communion
of the parish church; and there is little doubt
that the mass was celebrated in private for him at Rydal
Hall. John's mother, Dame Agnes, may have attended
during her widowhood; but her husband William, the
purchaser of the tithes and patronage, must&mdash;always
supposing him to be a good Protestant&mdash;have attended
more frequently at Coniston.</p>

<p>But Squire Daniel was a pillar of the church as well
as of the State in his neighbourhood, and his accommodation
within the building was framed in view of the fact.
The following entry occurs in his account book, under
July 13th, 1663. The monument referred to is doubtless
the brass tablet we now see in the chancel, and it appears
to have waited for its fixing for ten years after its purchase
in London:&mdash;</p>

<p>No doubt this is the fine old pew which still stands
between the pulpit and the priest's door of the chancel.
In it, for nearly forty years, the squire worshipped, with
his growing family about him. The regularity of his
attendance is shown by his account book, where every
collection is entered; and in spite of his frequent ridings
on public and private business, he never but once (till
the close of the book in 1688) missed the four yearly
communions in his parish church. On that occasion,
when Easter Day, 1682, was spent at Hutton, he attended
a service at Grasmere on the previous Good Friday
(held possibly by his order), at which his Easter offering
was given.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Given this day (being Good-Fryday) at ye Offertory in Gresmere
Church for myselfe 5s., for Will, Alice, Dan, Barbara &amp;
Mary 5s.</p></blockquote>

<p>The sums given were invariable: 5s. for himself, 2s. 6d.
for his wife (while she lived), and 1s. for each child.<a name="FNanchor_129_130" id="FNanchor_129_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_130" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>It was in 1675 that the sad necessity rose of putting
up a monument to his excellent wife. The brass was
apparently cut in London, for he sent to his Uncle Newman
there:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>3li 10s. 0d. towards ye paying for my late dear wifes Epitaphs
engraving in brass.</p></blockquote>

<p>Though 2s. 6d. more was paid afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Unto Rich. Washington of Kendall for amending of my late
Dear Wifes Epitaph in brass.</p></blockquote>

<p>Washington, who was entered in 1642 among the
"Armerers Fremen and Hardwaremen" of Kendal, and
was mayor of the city in 1685,<a name="FNanchor_130_131" id="FNanchor_130_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_131" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> was wholly entrusted
with the next family brass; for we find that under date
February 10th, 1682, he was paid "for ye Brass &amp; the
cutting of ye Epitaph for my Mother and Uncle Jo.
Kirkby, £4 10s 0d which my brothers Roger &amp; William
are to pay me again." But this was for Coniston
Church.</p>

<p>It was after the squire's second son, Henry, had become
Rector of Grasmere, and by his encouragement, that the
church was freshly beautified and "adorned." The
entry of 1s. paid in 1662 to James Harrison for "makeing
ye sentences w'in ye church" shows that something
was at once attempted; for it was as imperative that a
church should be "sentenced" as that the Royal Arms
should be put up, or the Commandments or Lord's Prayer.
All these were devices (expressly enjoined by the sovereign)
for covering up the nakedness of the churches after they
had been stripped by the Reformers of all objects of beauty
and reverence, in roods, images of saints, tapestries, &amp;c.,
&amp;c.; for Elizabeth and many of her subjects had been
horrified at the effect of changes that appeared to rob
the churches of their sacred character.<a name="FNanchor_131_132" id="FNanchor_131_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_132" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Frescoes on
plaster had, of course, been used from early times as a
means of teaching Holy Writ and Legend to the unlettered
folk, and fragments of such pictures are still to be seen
in Carlisle Cathedral. But at the Reformation, when
plaster and paint were again resorted to, only the written
word was permitted (with the exception of the Lion and
Unicorn); and the wall-spaces of the churches became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
covered with texts and catechisms,<a name="FNanchor_132_133" id="FNanchor_132_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_133" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> which were surrounded
or finished by "decent flourishes."<a name="FNanchor_133_134" id="FNanchor_133_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_134" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>In its turn the reformed style has disappeared, even
in churches peculiarly suited to it, like those of the Lake
District, where the rough unworkable slate is bound
to be covered by a coat of plaster. During recent restorations,
however, at both Windermere and Hawkshead the
sentences were found under coats of whitewash, and they
were in a truly conservative spirit painted in again.
Grasmere, weary of "mending" the sentences and
whitening round them, finally wiped them out in the last
century, and substituted the ugly black boards painted
with texts, which still hang between the archways.
Fragments of the old sentences were descried when the
walls were recently scraped and coloured.</p>

<p>It was in 1687 that a complete scheme of decoration
was carried out within the church, and one James
Addison, a favourite decorator in the district, was
engaged for the purpose. The contract made with him
is preserved in the churchwardens' book:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. Adison is to playster what is needfull &amp; whiten all the
Quire &amp; Church except that within the insyde of the Arche of
the steeple to paint the 10 Coman's on the one syde of the Quire
window &amp; the beliefe &amp; Lordes prayer on the other with 8 sentences
&amp; florishes in the Quire &amp; 26 sentences in the Church
with decent Florishes &amp; the Kinges Armes well drawn &amp; adorned.</p></blockquote>

<p>Later on comes the copy of an agreement in later
handwriting:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="head">March the 29th An'o Dom'i 1687.
</p>

<p>Mem'd. It was then agreed on by and between James Addison
of Hornby in the County of Lancaster Painter on the one part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and Mr. Henry Fleming of Grasmer the churchwardens and other
Parishioners of the Parish aforesaid: That the said James
Addison shall and will on this side the first day of August next
after the date hereof sufficiently plaster wash with Lime and
whiten all ye church of Grasmer aforesaid (except ye inside of the
steeple) and well and decently to paint ye Tenne Commandm'ts,
Lord's prayer and thirty Sentences at such places as are already
agreed on together with the Kings Arms in proper colours and
also to colour the pulpit a good green colour and also to flourish
the Pillars and over all the Arches and doors well and sufficiently,
the said Parson and Parishioners finding lime and hair onely.
In consideration whereof the sd. Parson and Parishioners doe
promise to pay him nine pounds Ten shillings when or so soon
as the work shall be done.</p>

<p>And be it likewise remembered the s'd Parson and Parishioners
gave him 05s in earnest and that the Parson is to pay the fifth
part of the nine pounds Ten shillings, the parishioners being at
the whole charge of the lime and Hair.</p></blockquote>

<p>The contract included the painting of the pulpit of a
cheerful green, as we read. It was a plain structure of
wood, and the "Quission" bought for it in 1661, as well
as the cloth then procured for the Communion Table,
were doubtless worn out; for we learn from the church-wardens'
Presentment for 1707 that these and some
other points about the church had been found wanting
by the higher church authorities. The paper runs:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The defects found in our church for and at ye late Visitation,
viz. The Floor of the Church-porch &amp; Isles uneven Flagg'd; The
South wall of the Inside fro' ye Bellfry unto ye East, dirty; A
decent Reading-pew, Com'unio'-Table-cloth of Linen, &amp; pulpet
Cushio' wanting; A Table of degrees wanting, &amp; a crackt Bell.</p>

<p>All these faults except two (viz. The Reading-pew &amp; crackt
Bell) are amended. The porch &amp; Isles even Flagg'd. The Wall
made white &amp; clean, A decent Table-cloth, Pulpet-Cushion, &amp;
Table of degrees, procured.</p>

<p>A new Reading-pew is in making at present, &amp; will shortly be
perfected. &amp; as for the Bell it was referr'd to Dr. Fleming's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>

convenient time to call together &amp; consult w'th the chief of his
Parishion'rs to do it, &amp; in w't time and manner, to the best
Advantage."</p></blockquote>

<p>Accordingly we find entries of the expense incurred
by a few of these requirements:&mdash;</p>

<p>Nothing is heard, however, of a new reading-pew, and
in 1710 the old one was mended at a cost of 1s. 8d. The
bells, as we shall see, had to wait.</p>

<p>Not until a hundred years later was a vestry thought
of. In 1810 Thomas Ellis was paid 7s. for planning it,
and George Dixon £12 2s. 1d. for its erection. It is said
to have been made of wood, and simply partitioned off the
north-west angle of the church. It was fitted with a
"grate," that cost with carriage 19s.; and this being set
on the side nearest to the pews, diffused what must have
been but a gentle warmth through the edifice. It is the
first heating apparatus that we hear of, and the expenses
for charcoal and wood, with 3s. paid annually to the clerk
for setting on the fire, were small. Tradition says that
while George Walker lighted the vestry fire he rang the
eight o'clock bell&mdash;a call to matins which had survived
the Reformation, and the service then abolished.<a name="FNanchor_135_136" id="FNanchor_135_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_136" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>Time brought other improvements. The harmony of
a church choir entailed its special expenses. In 1812
the ladies of Rydal Hall, widow and heiress of Sir Michael
Fleming, provided "Psalmody" for Grasmere church at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
a cost of £2 2s., and for Langdale at £1 1s. Probably
the price of this early tune-book was one guinea. A
charge of 7s. 6d. appears in 1829 for a new pitch-pipe. A
"singing school" was started, causing considerable expense
in candles (12s. in 1844). Edward Wilson fitted the
"singing pews" with drawers in 1851. There was
apparently no instrumental music in the Grasmere choir,
though there may have been in Langdale chapel to judge
from an item of expense for violin strings.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;"><a name="PITCH" id="PITCH"></a>
<img src="images/i_134.jpg" width="450" height="157" alt="pitch pipe" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Old Pitch Pipe</p></div>
</div>

<p>Many odd expenses are noted in the accounts, as well
as the replenishing of worn books and garments. A
large Common Prayer Book cost in 1692 13s. 6d., and
another in 1733 14s. Prayer Books began, too, to be
supplied in the body of the church; the townships
buying a few at a time, at a price varying from 6d. to 1s.
In 1808 a new Bible cost £2 2s., while the price of a large
Prayer Book in 1823 was £2 5s., and another in 1835
£1 12s.</p>

<p>The "surp-cloth," "surpless," or "surplice" was
renewed at various prices. After the marvellously cheap
one of 1661 (5s.; surely the product of the valley, in
flax-growing, spinning, and weaving), others were got
in 1697 for £1 12s., in 1730 for £1 11s. 4d., in 1734 for
£2 7s. In 1755 a new one is set down at the modest
sum of 1s. 5<sup><small>3</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>4</small></sub>
 d., which, if multiplied by three, is barely
4s. 6d.; and in 1775 one (or perhaps the same) was
altered for 1s. An amusing item appears in the receipt
columns of the three townships in 1795, when they sold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the old surplice and divided the amount. "By <sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>3</small></sub>
 of the
Old Surplice 2s. 7<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> d."</p>

<p>"Communion Linnen" cost in 1823 14s. 6d. In 1820
a surplice cost £2 18s. 4d., and in 1830 £1 17s. 9d.</p>

<h2><a name="UPKEEP" id="UPKEEP"></a>THE UPKEEP OF THE CHURCH</h2>


<p>The one document that exists concerning the fabric
of the church and of its upkeep was written as
late as 1661, when the Episcopal Order of church government
was restored.<a name="FNanchor_136_137" id="FNanchor_136_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_137" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> There is every probability, however,

<p>Something has already been said of the constitution
of the parish, and of the lay control which existed over
its finances&mdash;the three townships within the parish
being represented by a body of eighteen (six for each) as
well as by two churchwardens; and this document, while
it strengthens the suggestion that the great addition to
the church had been carried out by the united parish,
and at the expense of the three townships&mdash;shows us
exactly how each township arranged to fulfil its obligation
to maintain the building in proper repair.</p>

<p>It was an intricate matter. Each township by a common
agreement made itself responsible for the maintenance
of a particular portion of the church, not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of the fittings, but of the walls and windows of the fabric,
as well as of the garth outside, with the garth wall down
to its own particular gate of entrance.<a name="FNanchor_137_138" id="FNanchor_137_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_138" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> There were
besides general charges, along with the expenses of the
Sunday worship, in which all took an equal share. Such
an undertaking&mdash;both joint and individual&mdash;may seem
to a merely modern mind a complicated business, especially
as the church consisted structurally of two parts, which
had to be divided for purposes of finance into three.
But such problems were as nothing to men whose farmholds
belonged to a township (indivisible in itself) that
was broken up into several lordships, and whose land&mdash;though
permanent in quantity&mdash;was every year freshly
apportioned within the common fields of his <em>vill</em>. The
subsequent accounts of the churchwardens, of which a
few have already been given, prove that the obligations
incurred by this document were rigidly fulfilled.</p>

<p>The division of the fabric amongst the townships was
made on the following lines. The care of the chancel,
with its four windows and door, fell, of course, to the
recipient of the tithes&mdash;who at this time was the rector.
The township of Grasmere undertook to repair the south
wall of the church from the chancel door to the tower,
and half the aisle. The benches between this wall and
aisle were all apportioned to the folk of the township,
as well as a few odd ones in other parts of the church.
The windows for which Grasmere was responsible were
not, as would naturally be supposed, those of the south
wall, but three in the north wall nearest to the east.</p>

<p>Langdale's share was wholly on the north side.
Between the north wall, which it was bound to repair,
and the aisle, stood the forms on which the folk of that
valley were seated. The windows specially apportioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
to its care were the one in the east wall of the northern
half of the church (whose precincts were called the
Langdale choir) with the two in the north wall next to
it.</p>

<p>Rydal and Loughrigg (in which township Ambleside
above Stock was joined for church matters) was responsible
for the three windows in Grasmere's south wall and
for the porch. The forms for this portion of the parish
were apparently set in the middle of the church, on
either side the central arched wall.</p>

<p>The churchyard wall also was divided among the
townships: Grasmere taking the north-eastern portion,
with the lych gates; Langdale the stretch onward to
the tower, with its own gate (now closed), which was
opposite Church Stile, or Kirk Steel, then an inn; and
Rydal and Loughrigg the stretch beyond to the south,
past the present gate, which was reserved at that time
for the folk of the township.</p>

<p>Each township had clearly its own quarter of the churchyard
as well of the church, wherein to bury its dead.
Within, the portions were marked by the position of each
township's seats, and without, by the gates. The field
apportioned to Langdale, by Harrison's inn, was no
doubt used for the tethering of horses from that distant
valley.</p>

<p>The three townships jointly attended to the upkeep
of the tower, the bells, the roof of the church, the pulpit,
and church furniture.</p>

<p>When the regulations for church repairs were thus
solemnly written out, there was urgent need for them.
Neglect and ill-usage had reduced the fabric to a forlorn
state, and the accounts of the wardens (who, however,
went cautiously to work on renovation) show what was
immediately required for setting the place in decent
order and reinstituting the services and sacraments of
the established church. From the sum paid to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
"glasser"&mdash;6s., for glazing only Grasmere's share of the
windows&mdash;it would seem that the winds of heaven had
blown freely through the building. The font, which was
always displaced by the Puritans, and often maltreated,
required mending in the stone part as well as the lead;
and a new cover was procured. A table-cloth&mdash;presumably
of linen&mdash;was bought for 1s. 4d., a bottle (for the
wine?) for 3s., a surplice for 1s. 8d., and a pulpit cushion
for 2s. 2d.</p>

<p>The binding of the Bible next year cost 1s. It had
undoubtedly had hard wear during the diverse ministrations
of the Interregnum. It may have been the very
book bandied about on that Sunday of 1655 when John
Banks and his attendant minister were defied by the clerk,
and John, upon that official's persistence in reading
aloud a chapter from its pages, forcibly closed it, and
handed it to Mr. Turner. Also a Book of Common Prayer
was got for 1s. 6d., a sum so small as to raise a doubt of
its newness. The large sum of £1 1s. was expended on
"makeing up ye raills in ye quire," which shows that this
guard to the space about the communion table (often
maliciously broken by zealots) was in a bad state. The
rails were entirely renewed, and a fresh table made in 1755;
and it is interesting to note that they were constructed
on the spot by joiners brought from a distance, no doubt
Kendal. The wood was procured in Rydal, at a cost
of £4 12s., with carriage 2s. 6d. Other expenses, in
iron-work, turning "bannisters," glue, &amp;c., with the
boarding of the men, came to £2 1s. 0<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> d. No doubt the
existing rails are those then made, with the little table
now used as a credence table.</p>

<p>An object within the chancel is older than these. It
is a box carved with the date 1648 and the words "S.
Oswaldus Poor Box." It is strange that this object
should be acquired at a time when the country was at
strife and the church disestablished&mdash;unless, indeed, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">&nbsp;</a><br /><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">&nbsp;</a><br /><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
was the gift of a rich parishioner like Mr. Thomas Braithwaite
of Ambleside Hall, who was elder of the parish
during the rule of the Presbyterians.<a name="FNanchor_138_139" id="FNanchor_138_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_139" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>The placing of the King's Arms within the church was
obligatory.<a name="FNanchor_139_140" id="FNanchor_139_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_140" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> This was a costly business, for two men,
who brought the painted panel, had to be boarded in the
village. Some of the money went, however, in drink,
and the occasion was evidently made an excuse for village
jollity.</p>

<p>Gradually other articles customary in a properly-appointed
church were acquired. A table-cloth&mdash;this
time probably of cloth&mdash;was bought in 1665 at a cost
of 16s. 7d., and "A cloth to Cover ye Ellements" at 2s.
followed in 1672. The Communion vessels in use up to
this time must have been of the rudest description, for
those that replaced them in 1670 were of simple pewter,
except the "dubler"&mdash;doubtless a plate for the collection
of alms.</p>

</table></div>

<p>The accounts show no further expenditure on this
score, except for the repair of a "Flagon" (3d.) in 1708,
and for "Sodering ye Tankers" in 1726. The existing
plate was supplied by private piety, as its inscriptions
tell. The two silver cups bear the date 1714, and they
are of the same pattern; but one carries the cross with
sacred monogram and the legend "The Parish Church
Plate of Grasmere Renewed Ao. Doi. 1714" (having
been probably bought from the proceeds of the sale of
the older plate or by collected offerings), while the other
with a coat of arms inside its border, bears the inscription:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
"The gift of Mrs. Dorothy Benson of Coat How to the
Parish Church of Grasmere Ao. Doi. 1714." This lady,
wife of Thomas Benson, freeholder, of the homestead
by the Rothay, gave also a beautiful old silver alms
dish, said to be a piece of Dublin plate.<a name="FNanchor_140_141" id="FNanchor_140_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_141" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> The date on
this is 1729. She gave a silver paten also, on which
only the maker's date (1731-2) is engraved. It is singular
that each of the three pieces displays a different coat-of-arms.<a name="FNanchor_141_142" id="FNanchor_141_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_142" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Benson's munificence was clearly felt by the
parish, for the item in the accounts of 1729 "For Wine
given as a Present to Mrs. Benson," 8s., must have been
intended as an acknowledgment.</p>

<p>Another offering of plate was made much later (1852)
by Mrs. Letitia Lough, a friend of the Wordworths, who
resided for some time at Fox Ghyll, and later removed
to Grasmere.</p>

<p>In connection with the Communion vessels of the
Restoration period, it must be borne in mind that there
was far less use for them then than now. The sacrament
was at that time administered only four times in the year.
This fact is not only shown by the accounts of the Rydal
Hall agent and of the churchwardens, but it is expressly
declared by one of the answers made by the wardens at
the Presentment of 1723. They add that they provide
fine white bread and good wine for the sacrament "att
ye charges of ye Inhabitants"; and four years later
they append to this statement "Easter excepted, which
is at the Charge of the Parson."</p>

<p>Thus on three occasions&mdash;Christmas, Whitsuntide, and
Michaelmas&mdash;the churchwardens and the Eighteen were
bound to provide bread and wine;<a name="FNanchor_142_143" id="FNanchor_142_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_143" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> while the expenses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
of the Easter celebration were borne by the rector, who
received the Easter dues. When the tithes were leased
to laymen, this layman took over the charge. And as
Squire John Fleming held the tithes, items for this
expenditure are found in Tyson's and Harrison's account-books.</p>

<p>In 1632 6<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> gallons of wine were procured "against
Easter" for Grasmere church, at a cost of 13s.; and the
Easter bread (fine wheaten bread as has been said, much
relished by people whose staple food was oatmeal), with
the charge for procuring it, amounted to 10d. In 1643
8 gallons were got in for the same purpose, costing
£1 1s. 8d.; and next year 9 gallons, at £1 4s.&mdash;that is to
say, some 4<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> dozen bottles of our present size were drunk
on this occasion. The wine cost 4d. to 5<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> d. a bottle.</p>

<p>The amount of wine drunk by the parishioners seems
large, even when we remember that the whole of the
adult population in the three townships were bound
to attend, and did attend these solemn functions. Of
this there is proof, for every non-communicant was taxed,
as existing Subsidy Rolls show. It is probable that
when receiving the wine, the parishioner took a hearty
drink from the cup, and not a sip as at present.<a name="FNanchor_143_144" id="FNanchor_143_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_144" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>The churchwardens' accounts for bread and wine at
the three communions are accurately recorded after the
Restoration, as well as their expenses for the journey
required to procure them&mdash;the ride to Kendal being
charged as 8d., or if only to Ambleside 4d. Unluckily,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
however, only the sum expended is given, and not the
amount of wine. In 1666 the three sacraments cost
the parish 9s. 9d., 9s. 3d., and 9d. 3d. respectively; in
1668, 6s. 11d., 8s. 3d., and 8s. 3d.; in 1669, 10s. 3d.,
10s. 3d., and 7s. 9d. From 1681 the accounts kept
separately for Grasmere and for Loughrigg with Rydal
each show an expenditure for bread and wine; but the
Langdale division, which had now acquired the privilege
of a Communion in its own chapel once a year, was
apparently let off. The expenses for that year were set
down as £1 13s. 3d.; Grasmere paying £1 0s. 1d. and
Loughrigg and Rydal 13s. 2d.; the division being based
probably upon the number of communicants in each
township. In 1691 the total expenditure was £2 6s. 6d.,
and it remained at much this figure till 1729. The charge
from that time became a fixed one, Grasmere paying
7s. 2d., 6s. 6d., and 7s. 2d. for the Christmas, Whitsuntide,
and Michaelmas celebrations (which included two journeys);
and Loughrigg and Rydal, 4s. 4d., 5s., and 4s. 4d.
(one journey), and it remained at these figures till 1821,
when there was a change of rectors. From this date
the charge was exceedingly irregular, figuring occasionally
as high as £2 7s. 10d., while sometimes it does not appear
at all, the bread only being accounted for. Then it
dropped greatly. From 1833 Loughrigg and Rydal
ceased to pay&mdash;in consideration, no doubt, of the celebrations
held in the new chapel in Rydal; and Grasmere
figured at a sum under £1, or not at all! By a new
arrangement in 1842 Loughrigg and Rydal recommenced
its contribution, though on a new basis of irregular payments;
and this continued until the break-up of the
old order in 1857, when it joined for the last time at the
sacramental bread and wine provided at the old parish
church, paying 4s. 9d., while Grasmere paid 14s. 3d.</p>

<p>It may be of interest to note that with the new order
and the new rector (who kept a book in which he entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
particulars of the communicants) the bread and wine
for Grasmere alone cost £2 5s. 9d. When, in 1860, it
rose to £4 10s., the sum included 8s. paid by the rector
to the wardens in place of his Easter provision. This
ancient rectorial charge is mentioned for the last time
in 1865. It was probably coincident also with the
appointment of the Rev. Fletcher Fleming, that the old
order of sacraments four times in the year was changed
to a monthly celebration.</p>

<p>The following extracts from the accounts, besides
others interspersed in the text, show that the townships
carried out their separate obligations until the Vestry
revolution of 1856-7, a period of almost 200 years. They
apparently gave out their share of the work to their own
townsmen. John Birkett, who received 1s. for a "yeat
stoop," in 1755, for the Loughrigg and Beneath Moss
Gate, was a Rydal man. The ale charged 1s. 8d. in the
public auction, when that township let the contract for
the repair of its benches in 1783, was doubtless drunk
at the Fleming's Inn in Rydal, where such scenes were
frequent.</p>

<h2><a name="CLEANING" id="CLEANING"></a>CLEANING AND REPAIRS</h2>


<p>The townships joined at many general repairs, as
well as at the cleaning of the church, and the
expenses of maintaining worship within it. It is interesting
to note how extremely small these expenses were.
The cleaning, or "dressing," as it was called, of the
church, the greasing of the bells, the washing of the linen,
the writing of the register, the whipping of dogs out of
church, and the "drawing" of the accounts, all appear
to have been paid for at the Restoration at the rate of
1s. each per annum. This moderate fee was presently
raised to 1s. 6d., 2s. 6d., 3s., or 3s. 6d., but never rose
higher for over a hundred years. The "surpcloth and
table-cloth" were washed twice in the year 1662 for 1s.,
but from 1664 onward three times were allowed for 3s.,
and by 1702 the laundress had secured an additional
6d. for mending. The cleaning of the windows "and
sentences" (which were presumably touched up with
paint) became a regular charge at 1s., and the burnishing
of the church plate was 6d.</p>

<p>But there were other expenses, belonging to the general
charge, which, being irregular but frequently recurrent,
were troublesome to the wardens and Eighteen, whose
business it was to lay such a rate annually on the inhabitants
of the parish as should cover the outlay. Such
was the repair of the church roof, which was often needed;
even the moss (which it was the custom to stuff within
the rigging to arrest and absorb the wet which ran down
from the ill-fitting slates) required frequent replenishing.
Accordingly, after sundry payments made for "mossing
church" or "mending slates," the Eighteen entered into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
a contract, in 1686, with two Grasmere wallers for the
upkeep of the whole of the church roof, except the
choir, for nine years, for the sum of 7s. 6d. a year. In
1704 one William Grigg obtained the contract for three
years at the same rate, and undertook to keep the roof
in a sound state "as to Slatt and Moss (excepting upon
extraordinary Storms whereby the roof shall suffer much
Damage which shall be referred to the Eighteen the
Easter following)." Grigg, however, made no bad-weather
demands, and it was only in 1714, a year after
the contract had been transferred to Edward Hird, that
"a violent storme" caused the spending of 18s. beyond
the stipulated 7s. 6d. The parson and Eighteen then
(1715) transferred the contract to Stephen Haukrigge.
The sum was perhaps too small, for in 1718 John Warriner
secured 8s. 6d. on the contract. "An extraordinary
Storme" in 1719 cost only an extra 3s. The contract,
which afterwards rose to 11s. 6d., had ceased by 1732,
and odd sums for repair occur from time to time, such
as 13s. in 1733 and the same in 1734, with 3s. 3d. for
slates and carriage. But little was apparently done,
and by 1809 the roof seems to have been in a bad condition,
for the ominous item occurs "To cleaning Snow
out of Church 2s. 0d." It was radically repaired in 1814,
when £37 1s. 11d. was spent on the slates, £11 on timber,
which was paid to Lady Fleming, the wood being doubtless
felled in Bainriggs, and the extraordinary sum of £1 13s. 6d.
on ale to the workmen and "letting" the contract.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Bells.</span></p>

<p>Grasmere's pleasant chime of three bells is undoubtedly
an old one. The metal of the existing bells that sends
its resonance through the vale may be that of the first
bells, though robbed of antique inscription or mark by
recasting. It is quite possible that at the Restoration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
there still hung in the tower the Pre-Reformation triad,
stamped with an invocation to some saint in Longobardic
characters or with a quaint inscription in Black
Letter; for the Rev. H. Whitehead discovered in Cumberland
many an ancient bell that had escaped confiscation
and the melting-pot in the dark days of Henry VIII.'s
ruthless robberies and his successor's drastic commission.<a name="FNanchor_144_145" id="FNanchor_144_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_145" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>They were then, however, in a bad state, and the
churchwardens immediately proceeded to have them set
in order, as the accounts show.</p>

<p>It is clear from the items that one of the wardens,
Michael Knott, rode to Cockermouth in search of a bell-founder,
and that one was procured whose name was
John Langsha; also that he came over to Grasmere
and did the work there.</p>

<p>Now Mr. Whitehead considered that there was no
bell-foundry in Cockermouth at this date. When its
three bells were recast in 1673-4 the expenses of the
bell-founders' journey were paid, and they apparently
dug a pit in the churchyard and cast the great bell there.<a name="FNanchor_145_146" id="FNanchor_145_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_146" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
Such a method was resorted to when the remoteness of
the church or the badness of the roads made the carriage
of the bells a difficulty.<a name="FNanchor_146_147" id="FNanchor_146_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_147" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>Who, then, was John Langsha? Until more evidence
is forthcoming we must suppose him to have been an
itinerant founder. He or the firm he worked for may
have had head-quarters in some town of Cumberland,
and travelled thence to wherever they were called.
According to Mr. Whitehead, there was a bell-foundry
of some repute at Penrith in the seventeenth century.
The account books do not show how this renovation
of the Grasmere bells was paid for. The wardens paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
John his "earnest," and a small item that remained
after he left; otherwise the only sum of consequence
that appears is 9s. for two new bell-ropes.</p>

<p>Only casual expenses in connection with the bells are
given after this for some time. For instance, in 1669
the item occurs, "in drinke when we did turne midlmost
bell," 2s. 6d. But the presentment of 1707 certainly
discloses the serious condition of one bell, which was then
cracked; and the reliance of the wardens on the "discretion"
of their rector was misplaced, as nothing was
done. There would seem to have been no good founder
at this time in the adjacent counties; for when the bells
of Brigham were renewed in 1711, under the incumbency
of Roger Fleming (another son of Sir Daniel), a Gloucester
firm of founders was actually called to the rescue. The
bells, however, went no further than Kendal, where
there was, adjacent to the church, a bell-house which
could be hired, and there the Gloucester man superintended
the casting of them.<a name="FNanchor_147_148" id="FNanchor_147_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_148" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>At Grasmere, procrastination prevailed. The wardens,
in 1723, admitted "The Bells are not firme &amp; in good
order, but they are agreed to make them good as soon
as possible." In 1727 they again admitted the bells to
be out of order, but the ropes (it was declared) were
"good &amp; firm." In 1729 the bells still waited to be
repaired "upon a convenient opportunity." In 1731<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the great plunge into expense was at last taken. "One
of our bells is in good order, The Other two are recasting
at York &amp; the ropes are making, &amp; everything hastning
forwards to have them in good order." Accordingly,
the accounts for 1732 show the enormous outlay incurred
of £40 3s. 9<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> d., and next year of £49 3s. "Towards Casting
the Bells and other Charges;" besides £3 14s. 5d. for
"Charges for a Ringing loft."</p>

<p>It is of interest to note that the Grasmere folk, in their
bell troubles, returned to their old ecclesiastical centre
at York, whence their first bells would come, and where
there were good founders. The inscriptions on the two
largest bells, in an ornamental border running round
the crown, are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Information about our bell-founder
may be found in Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
J. E. Poppleton's <cite>Bells in the West Riding of Yorkshire</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_148_149" id="FNanchor_148_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_149" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
At the Restoration, and for nearly a century
afterwards, a firm of Sellers worked at a foundry in
Jubbergate, York. William, the first known of the
family, founded a bell which yet hangs in Eskdale Church,
Cumberland. Edward, who followed, died in 1724, and
was succeeded by his son, the founder of the Grasmere
bells. The second Edward used the same signatory
mark as his father, and it was the custom of both to give,
after the Latin inscription&mdash;and provided there was no
donor&mdash;the names of the rector and churchwardens who
were in office at the time of the founding. The Fleming
coat-of-arms undoubtedly stands for Dr. George Fleming,
then rector.</p>

<p>A catastrophe is disclosed by the presentment of 1798,
when the "least bell" was "burst and unringable."
It remained in this condition for eleven years, when a
private individual came to the rescue. Its inscription
runs:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>COPIA PAX SAPIENTIA Re-cast at the expence of Mrs.
Dorothy Knott 1809 T MEARS &amp; Son of London</p></blockquote>

<p>Dorothy Knott was probably daughter of John Knott,
of the Howe in Applethwaite, born 1728, and of the family
who removed from Grasmere to Rydal.<a name="FNanchor_149_150" id="FNanchor_149_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_150" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> From her
benefaction to the school, we learn that she lived in
Ambleside, where spinster ladies of means were wont
to settle.</p>

<p>The firm of Mears, who cast the bell, worked at the
noted old foundry in Whitechapel.<a name="FNanchor_150_151" id="FNanchor_150_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_151" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> If this bell went
to London, its journey was a long one. But the turnpike
roads were now made, which must have facilitated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
carriage, and the bell would arrive by what is now the
Wishing Gate road. An old man living in Grasmere
in 1886 used to tell of his grandmother, who remembered
the church bells having been brought by sledge over the
top of White Moss, then the only road into the valley.<a name="FNanchor_151_152" id="FNanchor_151_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_152" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
These must have been Seller's bells, for it is just possible
for three generations to bridge the 155 years; and
this traditional touch helps us to realize the remoteness
of the valley in those days, which no wheeled traffic
could reach.</p>

<p>When odd work was done in the belfry in 1775, a letter
from the bell-founder cost 5d. for porterage.</p>

<p>Casual repairs continued to be done in the place.</p>

<p>John Watson, the smith of Winterseeds, tinkered the
bells in 1807; and three years after, when the little bell
had arrived from London, the two others were also down,
for he was paid £3 14s. 8d. for
repairing them, and John Hartley
received the considerable
sum of £11 14s. 6d. for hanging
them. In 1764 bell-wheels and
clappers were repaired. The
head-stocking of the great bell
and two bell-clappers, in 1767,
cost £3 7s. 9d. Again, in 1773,
1774, and 1775, head-stocks, clappers, and repairs to
ringing-loft cost about £1. The ropes in 1769 cost
7s. 4<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> d.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 250px;"><a name="HAMMER" id="HAMMER"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Great Bell and Hammer</p></div>
</div>

<p>It is clear that Sabbath bell-ringing was for long one
of those boon services which the Grasmere parishioner
gave willingly to his church. Ringing on Gunpowder
Plot day, and some occasions of national rejoicing and
sorrow were paid for; but until 1692 nothing is put down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
in the accounts for ringing, only a small item for grease
for the bells. In that year, however, the Eighteen entered
into a contract with the clerk, who was to procure men
to ring on Sundays and Holy Days, and to furnish the
necessary grease, at the rate of 10s. a year. Next year,
on its renewal with Thomas Knott, the sum was dropped
to 8s. 6d. "and what more as the Eighteen shall think
fit." However, the new clerk, Robert Harrison, in 1695
secured 10s., and at this figure it remained for some
fifty years. After a gap of eight years in the accounts,
the item reappears in 1751 at £1, and from that time
onwards it fluctuates between the sums of 10s., 13s. 4d.,
£1, even once in 1759 touching £1 10s., as the Eighteen
were parsimoniously or liberally inclined. Finally, after
a halt at 15s., it rose in 1794 to £1 1s., and from that
slowly mounted until by 1814 it had reached £2 15s. 6d.,
at which it remained for eleven years. From 1826 it
rose again, and between 1831 and 1858 it stood at £3 6s.
£1 was then added.</p>

<p>The tower was an irregular source of expense, as the
following items show:&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p>Work was done on the steeple and steeple window in
1757; and in 1767 a load of "slape" cost 1s. and lime
2s. 6d. The work of white-washing recurred frequently.
Church and steeple were entirely rough-cast in 1773,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
at the considerable cost of £13,<a name="FNanchor_152_153" id="FNanchor_152_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_153" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> the east window (presumably
of the north aisle) being at the same time repaired.
The interior was done in 1780 for £1 5s. 6d., and the
exterior both of church and steeple in 1791&mdash;which with
the pointing of the windows came to £3 15s. The townships
repaired their individual windows next year, this
being repeated more radically in 1801.</p>

<p>The years 1803 and 1804 show that drastic work was
done. One item stands "To expenses of Letting white-washing
the Church 8s. 0d."&mdash;a sum spent mainly of
course in copious draughts of ale. Another is "To
writing Contracts of Letting 1s. 6d." The amount
actually paid for "mending Roof of Church, and Whitewashing
Church in and Out, and Pinning up all Broken
places in the Ruff Cast &amp; Plaster," was £8 12s.&mdash;certainly
a modest one. Church and tower were whitewashed in
1815 for £5 18s., and Edward Wilson, carpenter, received
18s. for a "Craddle to White Wash Steeple." The
process was repeated in 1832 at a cost of £2 17s. 7<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> d.,
and again in 1842, when Levi Hodgson was paid £4 15s.
9d. for the work.</p>

<p>The scraping, smoothing, and daubing to which the
church was constantly subjected, may account for the
mutilated state of such bits of freestone (shallow mouldings,
&amp;c.) as are yet visible. In what year Addison's
decorations were effaced by a coat of whitewash is not
known. It is supposed that the black boards, painted
with texts, which yet hang in the church, replaced them,
as being more convenient for the whitewashers. If so,
the once admired art of the painter was allowed little
more than fifty years in which to delight and instruct
the people; for one board gives, with the names of the
churchwardens, the date 1741. It is singular that in
that year the accounts show no unwonted expense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>An item that occurred from time to time for "mending
sentences" was changed in 1763 to an annual charge
of 1s. for "cleaning church windows and sentences."</p>

<p>Many little odd expenses there were: such as the
"hack" or pick, which, from its constant work on the
graves, often wanted "laying," or a new shaft, at 3d.
A fresh one and a "Cald-rake" were bought in 1715 for
1s. 6d.; while in 1802 "laying Mattock" cost 1s. 9d.,
and "New Coolrake" 1s. 6d. In 1824 a new spade cost
3s. 9d. Occasionally the church chest wanted "gimmers"
or hinges, or new locks, a pair of which cost,
in 1752, 1s. 4d. An "iron chest" was bought in 1816
for £7 17s. 6d. The ladder was mended often, and a
new one in 1734 cost 9s. The "Corps Cloth," procured
before 1798, when it was mended at 4d., required "Dying
and Pressing" in 1803 at 3s. 3d.; and it was renewed
in 1823 for £2 15s. A new bier cost, in 1812, 11s. 6d.
In 1821 a small hearse was built by Edward Wilson,
which could travel on the improved, but still narrow
roads of the parish. Its use was paid for; but in some
years it was not had out at all, so&mdash;as its initial cost
was £14 9s., and the clerk was paid presently 5s. a year
for attending it, and a "Hearse House" was soon found
necessary (£11 15s.)&mdash;it was not a paying affair.</p>

<p>Edward repaired the "Corpes Stool" for 2s. in 1847.</p>

<p>"A booke of Canons" was bought in 1665 at 3s. 3d.;
a register book in 1685 at 11s., and again in 1784 at 8s.;
a book of articles in 1691 at 1s.; and in 1692 "a Paper
Booke for Registring ye poor" at 2s. 9d., as well as an
Act of Parliament "for Setling ye Poor" at 3d.</p>

<p>But besides regular and casual expenses ever increasing,
there were special acquisitions too costly to be dealt
with in the ordinary yearly accounts. Such was the
church plate, and the bells (as we have seen), and, presumably,
the clock, which at an unknown date replaced
the dial. The present clock was, according to the terrier,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
presented in 1817, and was supplied by a Mr. Bellman,
of Broughton-in-Furness. The bill of 7s. 6d., paid to
"Late Mr. Bellman for dressing church clock," was not
entered until 1820, though the previous year the regular
charge started "To John Watson for attending clock
&amp; keeping water from it," which was £1 3s. 6d. for that
year and afterwards 2s. 6d. less. The old clock existed
till recently.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><em>Work on Inner Door.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>The church porch, like the tower, was repaired at
the general charge. This, in 1761, cost only 4s. 6d.
The outer doors of the porch were renewed in 1821.
Edward Wilson contracted for the wood-work for £5,
while John Watson executed the iron-work for £3 5s. 8d.
The priest's door was renewed also, being doubtless paid
for by the rector. These doors remain, and the initials
of the Winterseeds smith, which he stamped upon his
work, may be seen.</p>

<p>At the opening of the nineteenth century the condition
of the church floor and of the antique forms had become
a matter for serious consideration. Nothing effectual,
however, could be done in the way of levelling and paving
until the custom of burying within the church had ceased.
Even then there was reluctance and difficulty, for the
soil was full of bones, and so close to the surface did these
lie, that, according to tradition, many were gathered
and laid elsewhere, when the alteration finally was made.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">&nbsp;</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">&nbsp;</a><br /><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
This was radically undertaken in 1840. The floor, which
until then was below the level of the ground outside,
was filled in and paved. The old benches were removed,
and pews set up in their place. Foreign timber&mdash;deal
painted&mdash;was for the first time used instead of native
oak, and the wood-work was given to an Ambleside man.
The cost of the renovation, which included repairs to
roof and renewal of windows, amounted to £300, and
this was raised by subscription&mdash;Queen Adelaide (who
was visiting the district) contributing £50.</p>

<p>The abolition of the forms could not do other than
tend to the breaking up of old customs. The pews were
no doubt apportioned to the various households, in
Grasmere township at least; while the question of the
rightful share possessed by the sister townships in this
altered accommodation was left open, as the events of
1856 show (see Church Rates). With household pews,
men and women sat together. The western door, hitherto
used by the men, and outside which (according to tradition)
all secular notices had been given out, was now
made up. £1 1s. had been paid, as late as 1816, "To
John Watson for Hanging of Men's Door." At the same
time the tower-arch was walled up, and the tower used
for a vestry&mdash;the old wooden one being cleared away.
The font was brought into the church. The expenses
of the old vestry fire, which had risen to 5s., cease
accordingly, and those of lighting the "stove"&mdash;placed
presumably in the church itself&mdash;begin at 12s. a year.
Comfort was now thought of. Straw matting had
indeed been procured for the communion rail in 1780
(3s. 1d.); it was bought in 1844 for 11s. 4d.</p>

<p>The era of subscriptions raised the rate of church
expenses enormously, as has been seen in the 1840 renovation.
In 1876 the rough-casting of the church outside
was done by subscription, and contracted for at £30;
£70 13s. 0<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> d. being altogether expended upon that and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
new spouts and painting clock, a sum which should be
compared with the cost on previous occasions.</p>

<p>The Rev. E. Jefferies, who was the first rector&mdash;certainly
after the days of Dr. Fleming&mdash;to take a zealous
interest in the fabric, reconstructed in 1841 the entire
east wall at his own expense.<a name="FNanchor_153_154" id="FNanchor_153_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_154" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> He also presented the
two carved chairs that stand within the sanctuary. He
made with his own hands a communion-table<a name="FNanchor_154_155" id="FNanchor_154_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_155" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> and foot-stools;
the latter remain.</p>

<p>Another great renovation was carried out in 1879-80
under Mr. Fletcher. Like the last, its cost was defrayed
by offerings (£660), and much of the work done in 1840
was now undone. The deal pews were cleared away and
the existing oak benches substituted&mdash;Grasmere
workmen
being employed. The tower
arch was again opened out, and
the font replaced. A vestry
was partitioned off the north-east
angle of the church, which
was formerly known as the
Langdale choir. New pulpit,
font-cover, communion-table,
and Litany-desk were provided
in 1884, and five years later
the lectern was given by Miss
Agar, of Silverhow, in memory
of her aunt. The alms-dishes that hang on the south
wall were found a few years ago in the old tithe-barn,
which has been turned into a parish-room.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Churchyard.</span></p>

<p>From the Restoration there is evidence that the garth
outside the church was cared for. It was surrounded,
as we have seen, with stout rough-cast walls, which were
divided among the townships for upkeep. The space
within them was not strictly divided, yet the older
graves show that there was an inclination for each township
to lay its dead adjacent to its own gateway and
stretch of wall. The keeping in order of the grassy space,
with its ever-increasing mounds, fell to the general
charge. An item stands in 1673, "For dresing weeds out
of ye Church yard," 1s. 6d.; and a charge becomes
frequent for "repairing church-yard walks, 4s. 6d.,"
or "cleaning church-yard," 2s. 6d. Three days at this
in 1631 cost 6s. 9d.</p>

<p>Grasmere township paid in 1661 "For our P't of the
Dyell" 1s. This must have proved an unsatisfactory
time-teller, as in 1683 4s. was paid "For a diall &amp; post."
A post alone cost, in 1732, 1s. 9d., and again in 1743 a
new dial-post was fixed at 3s. 9d.</p>

<p>Trees were planted from time to time. Young ashes
were set in 1684 at a cost of 1s. 6d. The yew tree, though
no longer needed for the bow, was still grown. A fresh
one, planted in 1706, at a cost of 1s., perhaps took the
place of the old one blown down in the gale of December
18th, 1687.<a name="FNanchor_155_156" id="FNanchor_155_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_156" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> This, too, which would now have numbered
over 200 years, appears to have gone. The existing
trees were planted in 1819 through the instrumentality
of the poet Wordsworth (from a sum supplied by his
friend, Sir George Beaumont), and he continued to care
for them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>
<p>The poet himself lies beneath their shade. Of the
countless graves that stud this ancient burying-place,
it is his that draws the pilgrims from afar; and the yard,
encircled by its yews and the great mountains, has
perhaps inspired more and better poetry than any other
plot in England. Hartley Coleridge, Sir John Richardson,
Green and Hull the artists, are buried here, and their
graves may be found by referring to the short Guide
issued by Mr. Peterson.</p>

<p>Wordsworth's monument, a medallion by Woolner, is
within the church. The beautiful inscription is a translation
of Keble's Latin dedication of his Oxford Lectures
on Poetry to Wordsworth.</p>

<p>Grasmere settled down then, after the Restoration,
to an absentee rector, the Rev. John Ambrose;
and under him was a curate-in-charge, the Rev. John
Brathwaite. One of his name, son of William, "pleb.,"
matriculated from Queen's College, Oxford, in 1631, aged
18, whom Dr. Magrath thinks may have been he.<a name="FNanchor_157_158" id="FNanchor_157_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_158" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Under
Mr. Thomas Brathwaite's will, 1674, "Mr. Brawthwaite
minister of Grassemire" received a legacy of 20s., which
shows that he enjoyed the esteem of that Puritanical
gentleman. He often appears in the Account Book.
For churching the squire's wife he received regularly
5s.; until there comes the melancholy item in 1675:&mdash;</p>

<p>Other items are more cheerful; for often the minister's
little daughter would carry offerings of fruit, cherries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
and wild blackberries to the Hall, for which she would
receive a <em>douceur</em> in return. Also, as boys apparently
then caught woodcocks in springes, as they did later (see
Wordsworth's Prelude), the item occurs in 1782:&mdash;</p>

<p>The daughter seemingly married in 1685, for the
Squire's boys were dispatched on May 24th, with money
to give at her offering&mdash;a collection made at the wedding
for the benefit of the couple; Will giving 5s. and Dan
2s. 6d.</p>

<p>It was in 1684 that Parson Ambrose, who for some
forty years had been connected with the rectory of
Grasmere, passed to his long rest. By surviving five
brothers&mdash;several of whom were bachelors like himself&mdash;he
succeeded to the family estate; and the old Furness
homestead had been added to his other residences.<a name="FNanchor_158_159" id="FNanchor_158_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_159" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
The Rydal squire notes in that Account Book&mdash;which
became practically a diary:&mdash;</p>

</table></div>

<p><br />Little as Grasmere had known him, the old man remembered
the place in his will, and bequeathed £50 for the
school, under trust to the "minister and such persons
as shall be of the four and twenty of the parish of
Grasmere."</p>

<p>The death of Ambrose left the post vacant for Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Fleming, the squire's second son, who had been bred
up to the church, doubtless in readiness for it. He had
taken his B.A. degree in 1682, from Queen's College,
Oxford, and there he was still residing, in preparation
for his M.A. degree, to be taken next year. Presented
now by his father to Grasmere, he proceeded on November
22nd to Carlisle for his ordination, and next month
rode to Chester to complete the business of his appointment.
On January 7th he was formally inducted to
the ancient fabric, over which he was now&mdash;a young
man of 25&mdash;to rule; and his father on this occasion
opened heart and purse to his neighbours at the Church-Stile
Inn in an unwonted manner.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>" ... and spent Jan. 7 at Robert Harrisons in Gresmere
when he was Inducted by Mr. Jo. Brathwait 3s. 6d."</p></blockquote>

<p>The new rector then returned to Oxford, where he
remained until the end of 1687. Clearly he was in no
haste to settle down in Grasmere, at any rate before
his income was free from burden<a name="FNanchor_159_160" id="FNanchor_159_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_160" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> and until something
was done to the rectory, which wanted effectual repair.
His eldest brother assisted him in plans; and he wrote
to his father on March 14th, 1687, "I have received a
letter from my Brother William concerning Grasmere
church and Parsonage House, with a model of the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
he designes to build, which I like very well, if the money
will finish it, and adorn the church. But I am affraid
that it will fall short unless you be pleased to be assisting
in wood."</p>

<p>Probably the squire did assist; and it may be a stout
oak from Bainriggs that bears still the incised legend
"This House was built 1687 Henry Fleming Par";
which implies that the house was entirely remodelled.<a name="FNanchor_160_161" id="FNanchor_160_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_161" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
The work went briskly forward, and on June 22nd the
squire noted:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p><br />which meant tips and treats at the alehouse, and a great
commotion.</p>

<p>Harry was still in Oxford in October, but early in
December he was down, and preached to his people.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Dec. 11&mdash;This day my Son Henry Fleming preached his first
sermon&mdash;upon Romans xiii in Gresmere church, where I would
have been, had I had notice of his preaching.</p></blockquote>

<p>This statement shows Harry's nervousness in face of
his clever father. It may have been with reluctance
that he left the University where for nine and a half
years he had lived a student's life; but that his departure
was intended to be final is clear, from the fact that his
box followed him, the cost of its carriage being 11s.&mdash;44
lb. at 3d. per lb.</p>

<p>Harry would seem to have been a quiet, unostentatious
man. His tutor, the Rev. Thomas Dixon, wrote of him
to his father on his first arrival from the country, "Yo<sup>r</sup>
Son is both frugall and studious, and all that I find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
amiss in him is that he wants courage and heart, I do all
I can to animate and encourage him and to put some more
spirit into him. I hope disputeing in ye Hall will put
some briskness and metall into him, and teach him to
wrangle: He is one of three that yo<sup>r</sup> nephew Fletcher
calls his Juniors in ye Hall, So that they must endeavour
to bafle him and then heel cease to stand upon his Seniority
or att least to triumph in it. He deserves also all the
encouragem<sup>t</sup>, that may be, because he is willing to do
anything and frequents Prayers and Disputacons as
much as any one, though of much less Quality and honour
than himselfe. He has another fellow-Pupill of ye same
order that keepes pace with him, and they have combin'd
to sett patterns to all ye rest of their Table: I hope theyl
continue this their emulacon, and that yo<sup>r</sup> Son will also
excite others of his degree to ye same excellency and
p'fection."<a name="FNanchor_161_162" id="FNanchor_161_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_162" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>It is probable that Harry was never taught to "wrangle";
and though his abilities were excellent, he rose to no
high office in the Church, like his brother George. He
had a true interest in his parish, as we must suppose,
from the encouragement he gave to the people over the
embellishment of the church; and the accounts show
that "ye Dr." went over into Langdale at least once (in
1696) to preach and administer the sacraments. He
neglected the bells, as has been seen, and possibly the
wardens had a difficulty in getting hold of him; for
from 1694, when he acquired the living of Asby, Cumberland,
he resided there. He married, in 1700, Mary,
daughter of John Fletcher, of Hunslet, and on his death,
in 1728, left a daughter only.</p>

<p>With Dr. Henry Fleming was associated, as curate,
the Rev. Thomas Knott. This worthy man was doubtless
of the Grasmere stock that for so many generations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
had supplied able and prominent members to the village
community.<a name="FNanchor_162_163" id="FNanchor_162_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_163" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> He entered his name in the Grasmere
register as curate and schoolmaster in 1687. In 1694
he was promoted to the more independent (and doubtless
better paid) curacy of Ambleside. The letter he wrote
to his rector on the occasion of the Kelsick bequest,
which does credit to them both, has already appeared in
print.<a name="FNanchor_163_164" id="FNanchor_163_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_164" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> The Rev. Thomas continued to officiate in
Ambleside until his death in 1744.</p>

<p>The Squire of Rydal (who had been knighted in 1681)
died in 1701, and it was the curate-in-charge, Dudley
Walker, who preached his funeral sermon and received
the honorarium of £1 1s. 6d.</p>

<p>The removal of this strong spirit must have made a
difference in the parish. His heir, William, who purchased
a baronetcy, was a man of feebler type, whose influence
would be little felt in the parish. He ceased, apparently,
to worship at the old church, for in 1728 he bought the
two front pews in Ambleside Chapel, which had belonged
to the Braithwaites. On the death of his brother Henry,
he appears to have nominated for the rectory of Grasmere
one William Kilner, who immediately retired in favour
of another son of Sir Daniel, George, born 1667. He
was totally unlike his brother Henry in temperament.
Handsome in person, of good abilities, assured spirit
and pleasant manners, his path in life proved an easy
one. As a boy, he, of all the brothers, had found it
possible to ask his father for money, whether to bet upon
his cock at the Shrove-tide fight, or to enter his college
library, or even to engage in a trading venture.<a name="FNanchor_164_165" id="FNanchor_164_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_165" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> Once
within the church, he advanced rapidly, for his father's
old friend, Dr. Smith, Bishop of Carlisle, gave him the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
living of Aspatria in 1695, and four years later made the
young man his domestic chaplain. From that time he
accumulated benefices and honours. Made Archdeacon
of Carlisle in 1705, he became Dean in 1727, shortly
before his brother's death gave him the opportunity of
absorbing Grasmere. The wardens' presentment of 1729
states "Our expected Rector is not yet Instituted and
Inducted, the Cure is duly Supplyed by a Curate; we
know not what Salary is allowed him." The church for
the moment would seem to be poorly manned, for it
adds "We have no Parish Clark or Sexton at present."</p>

<p>The august rector, who had other benefices, was
probably little seen in his native parish; and in 1733
he resigned it in favour of his only son, William, who also
became Archdeacon after him. Next year George stepped
up to the post of Bishop of Carlisle; and in 1736, on his
brother William's death, he succeeded to the Rydal
estates and the baronetcy. His only misfortune was
the death of his son in 1743. He himself died in 1747,
and a nephew became possessed of Rydal Hall and of
the patronage of the church.<a name="FNanchor_165_166" id="FNanchor_165_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_166" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>It is risky to judge from negative evidence: but there
is nothing to show that George Fleming, bishop and
baronet, did anything either as rector or patron to benefit
the church where he had worshipped as a child, or the
parish whence he and his son drew an income for fifteen
years; the sole mention of him in the church books
being a statement that he held a confirmation there in
place of the Bishop of Chester. The wardens and the
Eighteen, with the curate, kept parochial matters going;
and the former, wearied no doubt of waiting for help
from the rector, tackled the great bell outlay in 1730-2,
as has been seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>After he had become bishop, George Fleming erected
in the choir the marble monument that commemorates
(in grandiose Latin) his father and himself.</p>

<p>The Rev. George Briggs acted as curate-in-charge from
1722. Though he may not have enjoyed a university
training, the facts of his life that have been found suggest
that his ministrations were beneficial to the folk. Like
the first "capellanus," of whom there is record, Adam
de Ottelay, and many another simple curate, he had
footing in the community as statesman, holding house
and land. In 1725 he first appears as "Mr. Briggs"
in the Rydal rental, paying a lord's rent of 8s. 4d. for
Padmar, or Padmire (Pavement End), which had belonged
to the Rydal manor apparently since the days of Squire
John. In that year also the minister, described as
"clerk," married Miss Jane Knott, of Rydal, daughter
probably of Edward and sister of Michael, who, for so
long, acted as influential agents to the Rydal lord.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jane Briggs remained long as widow in possession
of the Padmire estate; and the name of the Rev. George
Briggs&mdash;doubtless her son&mdash;appears as holder, after a
gap, in 1806; in 1819 that of the Rev. William Pearson
has taken its place.<a name="FNanchor_166_167" id="FNanchor_166_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_167" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the death of the Archdeacon had left the
rectorate vacant, and an unfortunate nomination was
made by the patron-bishop. The Rev. John Craik, B.A.,
was probably never resident&mdash;a fact quite usual: but
to this was presently added the more painful one that he
became incapable of managing his affairs, and his sister
had to act for him. Only five years after his appointment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Sir William Fleming writes of the complaints of the
parishioners, who with a church sadly in need of repair
can do nothing, since the rector will not come over to
see to it. Matters presently became so acute that a
petition was framed, begging the Bishop of Chester to
intervene, as Mr. Craik was out of his mind, and had not
been near the church for three years.<a name="FNanchor_167_168" id="FNanchor_167_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_168" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> Yet it was not
till the man's death, in 1806, that this miserable situation
came to an end.</p>

<p>The Rev. Gawen Mackereth was curate under Mr.
Craik. To judge by his name, he was a native of the
vales, and he apparently entered the church&mdash;like many
more in this period&mdash;by the door of the village school-house.
He wrote his name in the register on October 23rd,
1735, as "Ludimagister et Clericus Grasmereiensis,"
copying the inscription of Thomas Knott, though with
a fault in the spelling. Twenty years later he preached
for the last time his two yearly sermons in Langdale.
Sir William Fleming chose the next curate himself; and
he may have intended the Rev. John Wilson to occupy
the post of rector, should this fall vacant. But that day
was far distant, and Wilson&mdash;who seems from his action
with regard to the owner of Bainrigg to have been a man
of strong temper&mdash;lived but a short time after his appointment.<a name="FNanchor_168_169" id="FNanchor_168_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_169" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>He was followed by Edward Rowlandson, of whom
scarcely anything is known; but who&mdash;according to the
register that records his burial in 1811&mdash;served the parish
for fifty years. He could not have taught the school,
as the burial of Thomas Davis, schoolmaster, is recorded
in 1801.</p>

<p>Under him and Craik Grasmere must, indeed, have
slumbered spiritually. How could it be otherwise? But
by this time Craik was dead, after being rector for sixty-three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
years&mdash;surely a record term for a lunatic! In the
same year, 1806, Sir Michael le Fleming, the patron who
had never exercised his rights, died likewise. His widow,
Lady Diana, nominated as rector the Rev. Thomas
Jackson. With him the long record of absentee rectors
was broken. He is said to have sprung from a family
of dalesfolk. He united, like some early predecessors,
his spiritual office with a temporal one, and acted as
"clerk" or agent to his patron. With his assistance,
the heiress and Lady of Rydal Hall freed her estate from
debt, bought the ruinous homesteads of the village, and
replaced them by pretty cottages. Jackson was successful
also with his own affairs, and left a good deal of
property at his death, including Harry Place in Langdale,
Tail End in Grasmere, Brow Head in Loughrigg, and
Waterhead on Windermere. He lived, it is said, at
Harry Place, and on most days rode his pony (according
to the report of old Langdale folk) over the fell to Grasmere
or Rydal Hall.</p>

<p>It is well known that the rectory was let to the poet
Wordsworth. The premises had been sadly neglected,
the wardens having, in 1798, "presented" the "Rectory-House,
Barn, and out-Houses" as being in "a ruinous
state," but the new rector was too good a business man
to leave them in that condition. Dorothy Wordsworth
writes (May 11th, 1810) that Mr. Jackson is willing to
make the Parsonage comfortable, and will contrive a
good library out of part of the barn. Later (June, 1811),
she says, "There is an oblong 4-cornered court before
the door, surrounded by ugly white walls."<a name="FNanchor_169_170" id="FNanchor_169_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_170" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>This graphic touch is interesting and suggestive. The
place had apparently an ancient character, with a
strongly walled fore-court, capable of being closed and
defended. Such a plan&mdash;which was always that of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
manor-house&mdash;might be necessary of old for rectories,
where the tithe-barn, often stored with grain and hay,
stood temptingly, and occasionally was the subject of
dispute.<a name="FNanchor_170_171" id="FNanchor_170_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_171" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Now it is just possible that the rectory may
occupy the site of the former offices of the demesne. No
manorial lord was ever resident in this remote vale, as
far as we know; but a resident bailiff and a forester
there must at least have been, with a few underlings.
These officers would be placed in a lodge, stoutly barricaded
with wooden palisades&mdash;later converted into walls.
To this nucleus would be added, besides byres and barns
and smithy, a "knight's chamber," for the accommodation
of the lord, if he visited the spot, or pushed so far
in the chase; and nothing is more likely than that a
priest's chamber or house (along with the tithe-barn)
would find a place within this safe enclosure. In such
a case, the decay and final abolition of the demesne would
leave the rectory in sole occupation of the ground.
Wordsworth gave up his tenancy, after the death of two
children, in the belief that the spot was unhealthy. It
must have been still more so in ancient times, while the
marsh that almost surrounds it was still undrained.</p>

<p>On the re-construction of the rectory in 1895 the old
elevation was preserved as much as possible, but the
level of the ground floor was raised five feet.</p>

<p>Tradition also states that the Rev. Thomas Jackson
served personally the chapel of Langdale, and certainly&mdash;if
he lived in that valley&mdash;this would be more convenient
for him than the parish church. The curates under him
appear to have been men of ability and worth. William
Johnson indeed secured a fame as educationalist that is
recorded in the <cite>National Dictionary</cite>. A Cumberland man,
born in 1784, he appears to have come to Grasmere
as schoolmaster before the death of the old curate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Rowlandson. He began to officiate in 1810, shortly after
he had entered St. John's College, Cambridge. His stay in
Grasmere was short, for Dr. Andrew Bell, when visiting
Wordsworth in 1811, was so struck by his management
of the village school, that he offered him the post of
Master of the school then being built by the National
Society in London; and thither he repaired next year.
He became organizer to the Society and school inspector
and rector of a London church. After his retirement from
more active work, he returned (about 1848) to Grasmere,
where he bought a piece of land and built the house,
since enlarged, called Huntingstile. He was a friend of
Edward Quillinan, Wordsworth's son-in-law, and in 1853
edited his poems with a memoir. He lived till 1864.</p>

<p>Johnson's name occurs in the letters of the De Quincey
family. The future Opium-eater had just settled at
Dove Cottage, where he was visited by his mother and
sisters. The elder lady was a friend of Mrs. Hannah
More, and it is a little amusing to find that the aid of
that prophetess of the Evangelical Revival was invoked
for Grasmere, which was evidently considered, by the
strangers who began to invade the district, to be in a
benighted state. At one particular evening reception at
Barley Wood, Mrs. More's home, an effort was made to
engage her interest in what were called "the Christian
politicks" of Grasmere; but little was gained beyond
a vague promise of Tracts, until the opportune arrival
of Mr. Venn from Clapham, who gave hopes of help (for
a time at least) from the Sunday School Society in money
and books. Mrs. De Quincey, in reporting the matter
to her son, looks forward to the time when "experience
recommends the Institution to more effectual patronage
at home, where at present it is an experiment, and viewed
with indifference, if not with suspicion, by people who
must very feebly comprehend the value of religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
instruction."<a name="FNanchor_171_172" id="FNanchor_171_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_172" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> The "good Pastor" was to be cheered,
meanwhile, "under his difficult labour" by the magic
of Mrs. More's name, and the promise of more substantial
aid when the De Quincey ladies should arrive.</p>

<p>But aid was to be found at hand, which probably did
not excite suspicion. To Lady Fleming religion became
increasingly dear after home troubles left her a lonely
woman. Her accounts show that in 1817 14s. 8d. was
paid to "Mr. Noble Wilson, Schoolmaster"&mdash;possibly
for books: and in 1821 a fee of ten guineas was paid
him "for Teaching Sunday School." Mr. Wilson, who
followed Robert Powley (inscribed as curate in 1814),
must have been a favourite. He came over from his
cure at Witherslack in 1831 to bury Mr. Samuel Barber,
who had made "Gell's Cottage" (now Silverhow) his
home.</p>

<p>Evil days had fallen once more on the Grasmere rectorate.
The Rev. Thomas Jackson died in 1822. He
left two sons, one of whom, educated for the law, succeeded
him as agent at Rydal Hall. The other, William,
was bred up to the church, and no doubt his father had
hopes that he would succeed him as rector.<a name="FNanchor_172_173" id="FNanchor_172_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_173" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> But the
right of nomination had, unfortunately, passed into the
hands of Sir Daniel Fleming. No protest to the bishop,
as regards his choice, was of avail, and the nominee,
Sir Richard le Fleming, took office.</p>

<p>The rector remained at the rectory after his inhibition
in 1834, and curates, named Kingsley, Magrath, and
Harris did duty successively for two years each. Then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
in 1840, came the Rev. Edward Jefferies, who for so long
ministered to the parish as curate and rector. He
remained as curate when, in 1857, the opportunity came
for Lady Fleming to appoint her distant kinsman, the
Rev. Fletcher Fleming, of Rayrigg (already serving the
chapel of Rydal), to the rectorate, but when he retired,
in 1863, the Rev. Edward was fully installed in his office.
Mr. Jefferies died in 1893.<a name="FNanchor_173_174" id="FNanchor_173_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_174" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> The men who followed him
are still (1912) living; the Revs. H. M. Fletcher, W.
Jennings, J. H. Heywood, and M. F. Peterson.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Chapels.</span></p>

<p>Brief mention of the later history of the chapelries
under Grasmere may be made here.</p>

<p>Ambleside, when the crisis of the Reformation came,
took matters strenuously in hand, as we have seen. The
townsmen provided a regular stipend for a curate who
could teach Latin and Greek to their sons, and also kept
up the fabric of the chapel, in complete independence
of the mother church. Moreover the right of burial and
baptism at the chapel was secured in 1676, after some
opposition from the patron.<a name="FNanchor_174_175" id="FNanchor_174_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_175" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> Nothing, perhaps, was
definitely fixed with regard to the nomination of the
schoolmaster-curate, when the townsfolk undertook to
furnish his salary in 1584. They may have hoped that
it would be left to themselves; and certainly they, with
Mr. Braithwaite at their head, appointed during the
Commonwealth. But the strong Squire of Rydal soon
made it plain, that as patron of the mother church, he
meant to establish his claim to the patronage of the
daughter chapel, which stood on the Grasmere side of
Stock Beck.<a name="FNanchor_175_176" id="FNanchor_175_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_176" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> It has remained in his family ever since.</p>

<p>It may be well to give a list of the Post-Reformation
parsons of Ambleside (rectified according to present
knowledge), as well as the evidence of a provision made
for them in 1584. This evidence was found amongst
Mr. George Browne's MSS. too late for insertion in <cite>Ambleside
Town and Chapel</cite>, where the deed of 1597 is given
in full. It is an extract from a contemporaneous document,
written out in a memorandum book of Christopher
Birkett, who owned part of the lands of the Forrest
family in Ambleside; and it records the fixed contributions
of that family to the endowment.</p>

<h2>AMBLESIDE CURATES</h2>


<p>The names of two or three priests who may have
served Ambleside before the Reformation have
already been given. A new era was marked by the
endowment of 1584, and the appointment of an excellent
and learned man followed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">1585&mdash;<span class="smcap">John Bell.</span> He was the first curate to inscribe his name
in the Bible belonging to the chapel, which, after long
alienation, has been restored to the church.<a name="FNanchor_176_177" id="FNanchor_176_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_177" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> Bell's
latest inscription tells that he had then served (in 1629)
for 44 years. He was buried in Grasmere, December
23rd, 1634. His fine action in constructing with his
scholars a causeway across the miry bottom between
Ambleside and Rydal was long held in remembrance.
In his latter days he must have had an assistant under
him, for the burial of Leonard Wilson, "Scolmaister at
Amblesyd," is entered for February 12th, 1621.</p>

<p class="hanging">1635&mdash;<span class="smcap">Thomas Mason</span> (spelt also Mayson and Masonn). It was

"upon a private Pique"&mdash;so the patron reported

though the subsequent refusal of some of the townsmen
to pay their pledged contribution to the salary of the
curate was no doubt due to discontent.<a name="FNanchor_177_178" id="FNanchor_177_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_178" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

not been recovered. The diocesan registry does not
give him; but his name is entered in the Curates' Bible,
and moreover four of the Rydal squire's sons were placed
under his tuition in January, 1681. His stay was short,
and a collection was made for him in the chapel on
October 20th, 1685, to which the squire contributed 5s.</p>

<h2><a name="LANGDALE_CURATES" id="LANGDALE_CURATES">LANGDALE CURATES</a></h2>


<p>Langdale was, at the Reformation, in worse case
than Ambleside, where the townsfolk were rich
enough to put both chapel and school on a sound financial
basis. The Little Langdale chapel ceased to be. The
one in Great Langdale, bereft of its particular ministering
priest, was threatened with a like fate. Probably it was
never closed, however. An intelligent native would be
found to act as clerk for a nominal wage, and occasionally
the rector would visit it, and would administer the Easter
communion to those who were too old or ill to cross the
fell. Two clerks appear in the register before the Commonwealth,
who may have acted as lay readers. During
the Commonwealth the chapel would be wholly in the
hands of the sect that happened to be dominant for the
moment; and the fact that its pulpit was open to any
religious speaker undoubtedly caused the followers of
George Fox to be more numerous in Langdale than in
any other quarter of the parish. It was a Quaker who
resisted the Episcopal church service, when it was
revived. (See p. 88.)</p>

<p>But order was again established at the Restoration.
Weekly services were apparently conducted by a lay
clerk, and the Grasmere curate in charge came over
once a year to administer sacrament (at a charge of
2s. 6d. to the township), and twice or thrice to preach
(1s.). From 1680, when Langdale secured the privilege
of a separate communion, she ceased to contribute to
the bread and wine consumed at the parish church
celebrations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>The ritual of the chapel is disclosed in a Presentment
of its wardens for 1732, preserved among the general
accounts.</p>

<p>They have (they say) the Commandments set up
within the chapel; a Communion table; linen cloth;
patten; flagon and Chalice; Reading-desk and pulpit;
a Surplice; books, etc.; with bell and bell-rope. "Our
minister resides with us; he is not in Holy Orders: he
reads Prayers and Homilies." He is allowed "the usual
salary." Sacrament is administered every Easter. Baptisms
and marriages are solemnized by the curate of
Grasmere. No alms are received from the Communicants;
and they have no alms-box.</p>

<p>The separate parochial accounts kept for Langdale
continually give items for repair and upkeep of the
fabric and its adjuncts. One of these was a "common
stable," doubtless used for the accommodation of those
who rode to worship. After consultations, the re-building
of the chapel and school was decided on in 1751, and the
work was slowly proceeded with, at the expense of the
township, through the next three years. There may
have been always a priest's lodging in the valley. In
1762 the "Parson's House" was repaired for 13s. 3<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> d.</p>

<p>The following is a list&mdash;incomplete in its earlier part&mdash;of
clerks, readers, and curates who served the chapel
after the Reformation:&mdash;</p>

<p>Owen Lloyd was the son of Charles Lloyd, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the friend of Charles Lamb and for some time had resided
at old Brathay. He inherited considerable poetic gifts,
and composed the Rushbearing Hymn always sung at
the Ambleside Festival. He lived for a while with his
friend, Mrs. Luff, at Fox Ghyll, Loughrigg.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rydal.</span>&mdash;The chapel of St. Mary, Rydal, was built
by Lady Fleming in 1824 and consecrated by the Bishop
of Chester on August 27th, 1825. This new foundation
took a large slice out of the old parish, though customary
dues and tithes continued for some time to be paid to
the rector. (See later.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brathay.</span>&mdash;The church, which was built here in 1836
by Mr. Giles Redmayne, stands on the Lancashire side
of the river, but its parochial boundary took another
slice off the old parish, which was now wholly robbed
of the township of Rydal and Loughrigg.</p>

<p>So the old mother church, robbed of her daughter
chapels and the folk she so long fostered, rules to-day
only the little valley of Grasmere.</p>

<h2><a name="SCHOOLS" id="SCHOOLS"></a>SCHOOL AND CLERKS</h2>


<p>Latter-day clerks and schoolmasters present a
tangled subject, difficult to unravel. Sometimes
the clerk taught school. More often there was a separate
schoolmaster who served as curate, entering holy orders
for the purpose; for by this economy of labour two
meagre stipends were put together, and the rector might
even effect an economy on the one.<a name="FNanchor_180_181" id="FNanchor_180_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_181" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> Sometimes each
of the three offices was served by its own functionary;
and yet again it seems likely that they were occasionally
all filled by one man&mdash;in which case a deputy was hired
for the menial work.</p>

<p>The school of Grasmere was doubtless an ancient
institution, taught in days before the Reformation by
the resident priest. It is not unlikely that it would be
supervised by the visiting monk from York, for monasteries
were then the centres of learning. It would, of
course, be held within the church, or the porch, according
to the season, as was the custom. After the Reformation,
and during John Wilson's fifty-two years' term as rector,
followed by that of the erratic Royalist, Henry Wilson,
tuition must have been a good deal neglected, or left
to the clerk. One Michael Hird was serving as clerk
in 1613, and a Robert of the name in 1638, who may
have been a son, since the office was kept in a family
whenever possible. Robert Hird, "clarke," was buried
in 1680, which looks like ejection by the Presbyterians,
and subsequent restoration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>For we are left in no doubt as to the appointments
made by the new religious authorities. George Bennison,
proud, no doubt, of his office and of his smattering of
Latin, wrote in the register, "I began to teache Schoole
att Grassmire the 3 day of May 1641 being et Ludimagister
et AEdituus."<a name="FNanchor_181_182" id="FNanchor_181_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_182" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>From his spelling of the place-name&mdash;which never had
been anything but <em>Gresmer</em>&mdash;we suspect him to have
been a stranger; and it would probably be difficult to
fill posts on the spot that had been summarily made void.
Next comes "Thomas Wilson clarke at Gresmere in
1655." He it must have been who fought the battle of
ritual with John Banks, bailiff, before a trembling congregation,
after the minister Wallas had decamped.
(See p. 87.) He, in turn, must have lost the post at the
Restoration.</p>

<p>The Parliament passed a law in 1653 obliging every
parish to supply a layman for the care of the registers,
who was oddly called a "parish-register."<a name="FNanchor_182_183" id="FNanchor_182_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_183" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> Accordingly
this was done, and certified by the non-conformist magnate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
of Ambleside Hall. "Bee it remembered that John
Benson of Gresmere being elected and chosen Parish
Register of Gresmere by the inhabitants ther was approved
of and sworne before me the 9th of Aprill 1656.</p>

<p>Tho: Brathwaite."</p>

<p>John kept the office, as an entry in the accounts shows,
at least twenty years.</p>

<p>Rector Ambrose, when he left £50 to the parson and
"twenty-four" of the parish, in trust for the school,
gave an impetus to education in the place. The sum&mdash;or
part of it&mdash;may have been used for the erection of
a school-house. At all events, the quaint little house
still standing by the lych-gates was already there when
Anthony Dawson, statesman&mdash;incited perhaps by the
parson's example&mdash;bequeathed, in 1635, the sum of
£7 to a "School Stock in Grasmeer."<a name="FNanchor_183_184" id="FNanchor_183_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_184" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> He expressly
entrusted it to the patron, rector, and incumbent, "towards
the maintenance of a Schoolmaster teaching
Scholars at the School-House built at the Church Yard
Yeates in Gresmere."<a name="FNanchor_184_185" id="FNanchor_184_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_185" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>These legacies gave importance to the office of schoolmaster.
The choice lay then, as now, with the rector
and the lay representatives of the parish, at that time
the Eighteen, now only six. The appointment of young
Thomas Knott as schoolmaster, shortly after this accession
of funds, was an excellent one. Curate as well,
there is a question as to whether he did not occupy also
the post of clerk. He was termed clerk in the wardens'
accounts, when in 1694 he was paid 2s. for attending
the Visitation and Correction Court. But a man who
could appear at so dignified a function could hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
have swept out the church, or dug the graves&mdash;and
these, according to the Declaration of the Wardens
"We have no sexton belonging to our Church"&mdash;were
among the clerk's duties. He may have paid a deputy
to do these things, since there were perquisites belonging
to the post worth gathering in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Income of the Clerk.</span>&mdash;The parish clerk was, in his
way, as important a functionary as the parson. Like
the rector, he had no fixed salary, but took from early
times the offerings of the folk, which became fixed and
proportionate, like the tithes. From every "smoke"
or household fire, he had one penny a year. For church
ceremonials, when he acted as Master of the Ceremonies,
he received a fixed fee, 2d. for a wedding and 4d. for a
funeral. He was the accredited news-agent or advertizer.
For instance, when the Rydal and Loughrigg Overseers
wished to put a pauper out to board, in 1796, they gave
him 2d. "for advertising her to let." (See Tithes.) He
was paid 2d. for every proclamation in church or yard.</p>

<p>These ancient fixed fees lessened in value through the
centuries, as did the tithes. Various small emoluments
however became attached to the post as time went on.
If the clerk was a good penman&mdash;as he was certain to
be when acting as pedagogue&mdash;he might be employed
on the church writings. Besides the joint Presentments,
charged at 2s. 6d. (of which Grasmere and Langdale paid
1s. each and Rydal with Loughrigg 6d.), there were the
wardens' accounts to be drawn up, at a fee rising by
degrees from 3s. to 5s.; as well as a fair copy to be made
into the large register-book from the parson's pocket-register.
This last duty&mdash;oft, alas! negligently performed&mdash;was
long rewarded by 1s. annual payment,
which afterwards rose to 3s. 6d. These items occur
in the accounts:&mdash;</p>

<p>The contract for bell-ringing was given to the clerk,
and doubtless he secured a profit upon it. He had an
annual payment for lighting the vestry fire; another
(5s.) for "attending" the hearse. In 1822 the accounts
give&mdash;after an item for "cleaning" the church-yard and
windows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"To Ditto Sentences and Window and Church throughout self
and Boy" 7s. 6d.</p></blockquote>

<p>This was clearly not a school-master clerk, who enjoyed&mdash;instead
of receipts from menial labour&mdash;the scholars'
pence and the small stipend. If we turn back to enumerate
the men who served the office, we find Robert Harrison
(1695 to 1713) followed by Anthony Harrison.</p>

<p>There was no clerk in 1729, according to the presentment.
Gawen Mackereth (1736 to 1756) is entered as
"clarke and schoolmaster," though he certainly entered
holy orders; so he may possibly, with a deputy, have
combined the three offices. John Cautley was clerk in
1756.</p>

<p>After this came three generations of Mackereths:
George of Knott Houses; the second George, who filled
the office from 1785 to his death, at 81, in 1832; and
David, his son. These men were clerks, pure and simple.<a name="FNanchor_185_186" id="FNanchor_185_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_186" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
David pursued the calling of a gardener, working for
Mr. Greenwood at the Wyke. In his time it was decided
to give the clerk a salary. It began in 1845 at £4, and
was advanced in 1854 to £5, with the stipulation, however,
that one J. Airey should receive 13s. 6d. of it. But
David did not prosper, and he emigrated to Australia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
in 1856. He is remembered by Miss Greenwood as a
tall, fine man, like his successor; he used, after giving
out the psalm to the congregation at the desk, to march
into the singing-pew (which stood where the organ is)
and there lead the voices. Indeed, the parish clerk of
old, besides a tuneful voice, was generally endowed with
a fine presence. The family is spoken of in an old newspaper
of nearly a year ago. Grasmere, December 31st,
1909: "Death of a noted Guide.&mdash;Last week there died
at Grasmere one of the best known guides in the district,
and one of the best known characters in his day&mdash;John
Mackereth. He was descended from a very old family
of Grasmere statesmen, intimately connected with Grasmere
Church in three generations of parish clerks, and
earlier still as 'Ludi magister et clericus.' The Rev.
Gawin Mackereth held these offices from 1736 to 1756.
George Mackereth, of Knott Houses, parish clerk, was
buried July 23rd, 1785. His son George became parish
clerk, and was buried 22nd October, 1832, aged 81 years.
He was succeeded by his son, David Mackereth, who
held the office up to the fifties. David's son, George,
was much disappointed that he was not chosen clerk
after his father's time. He was a tailor, and also a noted
guide. He died in 1881, and Johnny as he was always
called took his place as guide. He was also boatman
in Mr. Brown's days at the Prince of Wales Hotel. In
these capacities he was known to hundreds of visitors,
who never came to Grasmere without looking him up.
Of late years he worked on the roads for the council.
He was great on wrestling, and for many years collected
money for prizes at the rush-bearing. He had no children,
but four brothers and three sisters, all of whom have left
Grasmere, survive him." One Brian Mackereth was, in
1677, ranked among the Freeman Tanners of the City
of Kendal. (<cite>Boke of Recorde</cite>.) In the same year Squire
Daniel gave 5s. "at ye Collection of Brian Mackereth's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Houseburning." James Airey, the next clerk (1856 to
1862), must have been a clever, ingenious man, for he
kept the clock in order from 1831. He was also appointed
schoolmaster&mdash;an office that had often changed hands,
and been united with the curacy&mdash;and Edward Wilson
was taught by him (along with the younger De Quincey
children) until he went with his brother to the Ambleside
school.</p>

<p>The school, meanwhile, had received other benefactions.
The church list records £80 given by William Waters,
of Thorneyhow, in 1796, towards the master's salary;
and good Mrs. Dorothy Knott followed this, in 1812, by
£100, the interest of which was to be spent on the education
of five Grasmere children, born of poor and industrious
parents. John Watson, yeoman and smith, made a
similar bequest in 1852, stipulating that the recipients
should be chosen annually by the trustees of the school.
In 1847 Mr. Vincent G. Dowley gave £10.</p>

<p>While the salary of the master was paid out of the
school "stock" or endowment, the township took upon
itself the maintenance of the school-house; and the
expenses were duly entered in the accounts of the Grasmere
"Third." The waller of those days was differently
remunerated from the workman of these. For instance,
the large statement of 1729 "For mending the School-house"
is followed by the small sum of 14s. 6d. Naturally
the windows wanted "glassing" from time to time.
Occasionally new forms were procured&mdash;four in 1781
cost 5s. 4d.; or a new table, in 1805.</p>

<p>A loft or upper floor was constructed in the small
house in 1782, the opportunity apparently being taken
when the Grasmere township had bought an oak-tree
for the renewal of their decayed benches in the church,
and while workmen were on the spot. The expences
stand as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The little house, so stoutly built and prudently kept
up, remains the same, only that partitions have been
erected for rooms, and the entrance has been changed
from the church-yard to the outer side. The cupboard
where the boys kept their books, the pump where they
washed their hands, may still be seen. School was held
within its walls till 1855, when the present schools were
built.</p>

<p>With James Airey, who acted as both, the record of
former schoolmasters and clerks may be closed. But one
who, appointed in 1879, served the office of verger (substituted
for clerk) up to 1906, must be mentioned. Edward
Wilson was son of the carpenter of the same name, and
he pursued the craft himself. No custodian of old could
have filled the office with greater reverence or dignity,
nor graced it by a finer presence. Intelligent, calm,
quietly humourous, he was also gifted with an accurate
memory of the events of his youth; and his death, in
1910, at the age of 88 seems truly to have shut to finally
the door of Grasmere's past.</p>

<h2><a name="RATES" id="RATES"></a>THE CHURCH RATES</h2>


<p>The church rate, levied by the wardens and the
Eighteen on the parishioners for the up-keep of
the church, must for long have stood at a low figure. In
Squire Daniel's Account-book for February 16-62/63 the
item appears "Paid ye other day an Assess to ye church
for my little tenem<sup>t</sup> in Gressmer 00 00 02."</p>

<p>This was a small farm-hold at the Wray, which he
had inherited from his uncle. And forty years later,
when the year's expenditure was high, the freeholder,
Francis Benson of the Fold, was rated no higher than
5s. 9d. for all his lands. The general charges after 1662,
when the equipment for the episcopal services was complete,
up to 1810, averaged in those years when there
was no extraordinary outlay, barely more than £2, to
which, of course, were added those incurred by each
township individually. In 1733, when the bells caused
a great outlay, it is possible that money was borrowed,
for an item stands "For interest to Jane Benson 5s. 0d."
Rydal and Loughrigg furnished, in 1661, the sum of
£2. 9s. as its share in the maintenance of the church;
and in 1682, £1. 5s. 6d.; while in 1733 it mounted to
£13. 3s. 7d., of which the special Ambleside churchwarden
produced, on behalf of his district, 19s. 1d.</p>

<p>When the churchwardens' books re-open in 1790, the
general charges stand at £2. 2s. 7<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> d., and those of the
three townships united at £7. 13s. 2<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> d.; our township
paying of this £2. 2s. 1d. The following table shows the
progress of expense:&mdash;</p>

<p><br />The extraordinary expense of 1810 was caused by the
building of the vestry and hanging of the bells. In the
year of the great outlay upon the roof (1814), when Rydal
produced £35. 19s. 11d. and £14. 7s. 4d. from Ambleside,
the wardens laid for the last time but one, the old church
rate or "sess." Henceforth, the Overseers of the Poor
took it over, and so long as it lasted paid it out of the
Poor Rate. This seems to have been a period of laxity,
when the old spirit of responsibility and watchful care
in the custodians of the building, as representatives of
their townships, became weakened. It was now, in
1816, when the wardens and Eighteen would seem to have
less to do, that an annual dinner was instituted for them
and the "minister." This cost 2s. a head; and though
at the Easter Meeting of 1849 "it was resolved that in
future the Landlord at the Red Lion Inn shall provide
dinners for the 24 at the Rate of 1s. 6d. p<sup>r</sup> Head, Ale also
to be Included in the said Sum," the sum paid remained
£2.</p>

<p>A fee of 1s. 4d. paid to the churchwardens on entry
or exit from office (which covered his journey to Kendal)
had long been customary. Besides this fee, his expenses
began in 1826 to be paid separately at the rate of 3s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>But the old order, long decrepit, was soon to be wiped
out. Strangers were pressing into the remote valley,
which Gray had found in 1769 without one single gentleman's
residence. Not only poets and literary men
began to settle in it, but rich men from cities, who bought
up the old holdings of statesmen and built "mansions"
upon them. These men demanded accommodation in
the old parish church of a kind befitting their notions
of dignity. Opposition seems to have been made to their
demands. It is not quite easy to discover, from the
account given in the churchwardens' book of the meetings
held about the matter in 1856 and 1857, where the difficulty
lay. We may surmise, however, that while the
seats in the Grasmere division of the church were full to
overflowing, those belonging to the other townships
would be often vacant, since not only the old Chapels of
Ambleside and Langdale were in use for regular worship
and communion, but new ones were built for Rydal
and Brathay. It is possible that an attempt to sweep
away the traditional divisions and put Grasmere folk
in Langdale or Loughrigg seats produced the dead-lock
we read of. At all events, a vestry meeting was held
on July 24th, 1856, with the Rev. Sir Richard Fleming
in the chair, "to consider the propriety of making such
an arrangement with respect to the free and open sittings
in the church as may conduce to the general convenience of
the inhabitants; and preparatory to an allotment by
the churchwardens of such free and open Sittings among
the parishioners in proportion to their several requirements,
due regard being had to all customary Sittings
and to the rights of persons, having property in pews."
This proposal was made by Mr. Tremenhere and seconded
by Captain Philipps, both new-comers, though the latter
(who had opened the Hydropathic Establishment at the
Wray) seems to have been chosen as one of the Eighteen;
and it was promptly negatived by a majority of nineteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
to four. Mr. Thomas H. Marshall, another new resident,
at whose instigation the matter had been begun, persisted
in it however; and the two wardens for Grasmere
agreed to take lawyer's counsel as to their action in
carrying out a Faculty already procured, and for which
they paid Dr. Twiss £3. 6s. This counsel is not very
clear, but paragraph ii. of its text is of interest: "I
think that the appropriation of any number of pews in
a Mass to the separate townships, so as to exclude permanently
the Inhabitants of the parish in general from
the use of them, would be a proceeding in contradiction
to the express provisions of the Faculty. The Faculty
must be taken to have superseded any antecedent custom
under which pews in a mass were appropriated to separate
townships. I think it is the duty of the Churchwardens
to assign to such parishioners as shall apply from time to
time, indiscriminately as regards the townships, pews or
seats, as the case may be, among the free and open
sittings." Again, after expressing his opinion that the
burden of the church rate should fall on the inhabitants
in general, he speaks of "the custom for the townships
to repair their own portions of the Church applied to the
Church in the state in which it was, and under the exceptional
arrangements of the Sittings which existed prior
to the issuing of the Faculty.... The manner of collecting
the rate by the officers of the townships may still hold
good, but the rule of assessment must, I think, be derived
from the general law."</p>

<p>The Archdeacon was likewise applied to by Mr. Marshall
and Mr. Stephen Heelis, a lawyer from Manchester, who
had bought a holding at Above Beck, and had built
himself a house there. He was an able man, and at once
took a prominent part in the proceedings. He was made
churchwarden for Grasmere, and with his colleague,
William Wilson, set to work in 1857 upon the unrestricted
allotment of seats countenanced by the authorities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
This was the end of the individual shares held by the
townships in the fabric of the old mother church; it
was the end of the Eighteen who had represented the
township; it was an end, likewise, of the general church
rate for which those Eighteen stood responsible; since
it was manifestly unfair to tax those whose rights had
been taken away. Langdale fell away, and the Brathay
part of Loughrigg, and Ambleside-above-Stock. The
rate of 1<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> d. in the £ on property, which the wardens
proceeded to levy on the whole of the parishioners, was
responded to for the last time in 1858, when Ambleside
paid £7, Rydal and Loughrigg £10 17s. 10d., and Langdale
£8 6s. 3d., to Grasmere's £13 14s. 11<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>4</small></sub>
d. The little
division of Rydal with part of Loughrigg was indeed,
by dint of its being dubbed a chapelry, held yet a little
longer in the grasp of the old church; four statesmen
and one warden were allowed her in return for the rate
she continued to pay. This she seems at first to have
paid equally with Grasmere, and in 1859 she contributed
the high figure of £15 0s. 10<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> d. towards the expenses of
the church. In 1861 she paid £13 5s. 1<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> d. By 1866,
however, the rate to supply the immensely increased
expenses of worship had become a burden, even to Grasmere
folk. A voluntary rate took its place, and Rydal
contributed its unspecified portion to this for the last
time in 1870. The offertory that then superseded all
rates, paid only by worshippers, was an immediate success.</p>

<p>In 1879, when the volume of accounts closes, the year's
expenditure stands at £155 14s. 1d.</p>

<h2><a name="RATEPAYERS" id="RATEPAYERS">NON-RATEPAYERS</a></h2>


<p>The religious factions&mdash;whether Baptist, Anabaptist,
Independent or Presbyterian&mdash;that had sprung up
during the Commonwealth left behind them no vital
seeds of dissent in the wide parish of Grasmere, although
the two last had in turn held the rectorate and the pulpit.
As soon, indeed, as the Episcopal Church was restored,
along with the Monarchy, the people returned with
apparently a willing mind, and almost unanimously, to
the old order of worship.</p>

<p>There was an exception, however, to be found in the
Quakers, who were firm in refusing to re-enter the Church.
George Fox, wandering on foot like an old Celtic missionary,
had made his appearance in these parts in 1653,
and at once his preaching (which mirrored his mystic
and simple mind), united with a magnetic personality,
had secured him a following. His teaching discountenanced
all creeds, forms, and ritual. His meetings were,
therefore, held in private houses; and so much abhorred
by his followers was the "steeple-house" with its consecrated
ground, as well as any fixed form of service (even
the Office for the Burial of the Dead), that they often
laid their dead in silence in their own garden-ground,
rather than carry them to the church.</p>

<p>As the little band grew larger, a plot of ground was,
however, secured as early as 1658 at Colthouse, near
Hawkshead, in Lancashire, as a graveyard<a name="FNanchor_187_188" id="FNanchor_187_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_188" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>; and in
that neighbourhood, where they built a meeting-house
in 1688,<a name="FNanchor_188_189" id="FNanchor_188_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_189" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> they became numerous and active; and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the Westmorland side of the Brathay&mdash;in Langdale
and in Loughrigg more especially&mdash;George Fox also
found adherents. In particular, Francis Benson, freeholder
of the Fold, of a wealthy family of clothiers, and
an influential man who served as Presbyterian elder in
1646, became his follower; and remained so through
the persecutions. He received Fox into his house, even
when the preacher had become a marked man. Fox's
<cite>Journal</cite>, after recording his Keswick preachings in 1663,
runs on:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We went that night to one Francis Benson's in Westmorland;
near Justice Fleming's House. This Justice Fleming was at
that time in a great Rage against Friends, and me in particular;
insomuch that in the open Sessions at Kendal just before, he had
bid Five Pounds to any Man, that should take me; that Francis
Benson told me. And it seems as I went to this Friend's House,
I met one Man coming from the Sessions, that had this Five
Pounds offered him to take me, and he knew me; for as I passed
by him, he said to his Companion, That is George Fox: Yet
he had not power to touch me: for the Lord's power preserved
me over all.</p></blockquote>

<p>The fanatical spirit of Fox is shown perhaps in this
passage, where he ascribes the inaction of these two
parishioners of Grasmere, not to a generous tolerance
of mind (certainly God-given), but to a direct interposition
of Providence in his own favour. He likewise
attributes the death of the Squire's good and gentle
wife later on to God's wrath and judgment upon the
husband for his persecution of the Friends.</p>

<p>In truth, Squire Daniel was not the man to view
leniently the opposition offered by the new sect to the
restoration of the old form of worship. It must be
allowed that the method of their preachers was not only
irritating but provocative; for it was their wont, when
the congregation was assembled in the "steeple-house"
to rise and denounce both worship and officiating clergy
as instruments of Belial; with an occasional result of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
rough handling and ejection by the people. We have
seen that William Wilson, a Langdale man and one of
their speakers, resorted to this method of interruption
when the Church of England service was restored in the
chapel. The parson of Windermere later on wrote to
Squire Daniel begging his magisterial help, as a woman
was in the habit of rising during worship and denouncing
him. Wilson's misdemeanour was immediately dealt
with at the Quarter Sessions, and on his refusing to swear
the oath&mdash;a matter of principle with the Quakers, which
was not rightly understood, and which made their offence
a political one&mdash;was thrown into gaol, where, if his fine
of a hundred marks was not paid in six weeks, he was
to remain for six months, and to be brought again before
the magistrates.<a name="FNanchor_189_190" id="FNanchor_189_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_190" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>This was certainly a severe judgment. How the case
ended is not apparent, nor how long Wilson remained
in prison. A letter exists at Rydal Hall, addressed to
"Justice fleeming" and signed L.M., reproaching him
for his treatment of the Quakers, especially of the four
now in prison. One of these is "Wm. Willson, thy poore
neighbour," of whose wife and children the Squire is
admonished to have a care, since the prisoner had little
but what he got by his hands&mdash;a statement which implies
that Wilson was a craftsman.</p>

<p>The Rydal Squire had at first believed that he could
force the Friends back to the common worship in the
old parish church by means of fines, for he had the frugal
man's belief that the pocket can be made to act upon
the conscience. With the passing of the Act of Uniformity
(1662) and the later Conventicle and Five Mile Acts,
however, he and his fellow magistrates had a powerful
legal hold over them. It is clear that he caused the
known Quakers of the parish to be watched. One,
James Russell, brought him word that there had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
a meeting on November 1st, 1663, at the house of John
Benson, of Stang End. This was on the Lancashire
side of Little Langdale beck, but the Westmorland folk
who attended were Francis Benson, his son Bernard,
"Regnhold" Holme, Michael Wilson, and Barbara
Benson. Of Lancashire folk there were only Giles
Walker, wright, who had walked from Hawkshead, and
William Wilson and his wife. Wilson was the speaker,
so his imprisonment had not damped his ardour. Again,
next year, the constable of Grasmere, Thomas Braithwaite,
and a churchwarden, Robert Grigge, gave evidence
that certain Quakers had been seen returning from Giles
Walker's house near Hawkshead; and among them were
William Harrison, of Langdale, and Edward Hird, of
Grasmere.</p>

<p>These doings were not passed over by the Squire.
He even tried conclusions with the most powerful of
the sect, Francis Benson, of the Fold, and accordingly
the latter was summoned, in 1663, along with his wife
Dorothy, to appear at the Quarter Sessions to answer
the charge of having been present at a meeting. The
penalty of non-appearance was a fine of thirty shillings,
while the fines of John Dixon and William Harrison,
both of Langdale, charged with the same offence, were
respectively twenty shillings and ten shillings. Francis
Benson probably cleared his legal mis-demeanours by
money payments, for no evidence has been found of his
imprisonment. He and his family, however, remained
staunch Friends. The place of his sepulchre is not known,
though his death is recorded for February, 1673, of "Fould
in Loughrig," in the Quaker Registers. There is a
tradition of a burying-ground at the Fold, somewhere
about his now vanished homestead, and it is quite possible
that some members of the family might be buried there,
as the early Friends not infrequently made a grave-plot
on their own ground. The Fold was so much a centre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
of the sect that a marriage took place there between
William Satterthwaite, of Colthouse, and the daughter
of Giles Walker, of Walker Ground, Hawkshead, on
December 11th, 1661.<a name="FNanchor_190_191" id="FNanchor_190_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_191" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> According to another tradition,
a Baptist Meeting-house stood at the Fold, and an old
man, named Atkinson, whose forbears had owned the
adjacent farmhold of the Crag&mdash;where he was then
living&mdash;pointed out the exact spot on a little triangle
by the road where the building had stood, and the "Dipping"
took place. But this story is against all record,
for we can trace the Bensons' adherence to the Friends
to a late period.</p>

<p>A large number of Quakers travelled to Rydal in 1681
to make their Test or Declaration before Squire Daniel
and his son, but the only folk of the parish among them
were Bernard Benson, of Loughrigg, and Jane his wife,
and "Regnald" Holme, of Clappersgate, and his wife
Jane.</p>

<p>In 1684 a Rydal man "presented" before the justices
quite a concourse of people who had been present at a
"Conventicle" in Langdale. Some seventeen Loughrigg
and Langdale names were cited: Edward Benson of
High Close (his only appearance as a Dissenter), John
Dixon of Rosset in Langdale, William and James Harryson
of Harry Place, "Regnald" and Jane Holme of
Loughrigg, James Holme, the Willsons of Langdale, etc.</p>

<p>Reginald Holme's name frequently appears in the
Indictment Book of the Quarter Sessions, and generally
in connection with secular disputes. He was, in fact, a
turbulent character, little fitted to belong to the peace-loving
sect, which he joined possibly from sheer love of
dissent. Some items of his history have been given
elsewhere. He owned the mill at Skelwith Bridge&mdash;probably
then, as later, a corn-mill, though it is extremely
likely that a walk-mill would be set up additionally on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
this fine flow of water. About this water and other
matters he was in constant dispute with his neighbours.
One altercation, with a certain Thomas Rawlingson, the
Friends tried to settle for him but as he refused to accept
their verdict, a resolution was passed at a Monthly
Meeting, held at Swathmoor (1676), that the law might
now take its course. On another occasion Reginald
was brought up before the Magistrates for assault; but
the recurring bone of contention was a dam or weir
which he had built across the river for the good of his
mill&mdash;and to the damage, it was declared, of the pathway
above, and of his neighbours' grounds. The Rydal
Squire twice headed a party for the forcible destruction
of this dam, as has been told<a name="FNanchor_191_192" id="FNanchor_191_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_192" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>; but long afterwards
Holme was in fierce conflict with Michael Satterthwaite,
of Langdale, yeoman, about this or another dam.<a name="FNanchor_192_193" id="FNanchor_192_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_193" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>
Finally, in 1684, a crisis occurred, and Reginald's goods
were seized by the strong arm of the law&mdash;a most unwonted
proceeding; on which occasion his sons and his
daughter fell upon the unfortunate officers, and beat
them and put them forth with violence&mdash;which made
another indictable offence.</p>

<p>After the law-suit concerning the tithes, which followed
upon the Restoration (see ante), in which law-suit Francis
Benson was concerned, and possibly other Quakers, we
have no evidence as to whether the sect continued to
oppose the payment of church scot. But there is
abundant evidence to show that they were resolute in
non-attendance at church, and in refusal to pay the
church rate or "sess" levied on the townships for the
upkeep of the fabric and its walls by the representative
men of the parish. The Subsidy Rolls of 1675 show that
Francis Benson paid for himself and his wife Dorothy
the tax of 1s. 4d., which the Government demanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
from all non-communicants, as did "Reynald" Holme
for self and wife, and John Benson of Langdale.</p>

<p>From wardens' accounts and presentments we gain
many particulars of the dissenters of the parish, who
appear to diminish in number as time goes on. It had
become necessary by 1694 to account, in the books, for
the deficit caused by the Friends' non-payment; and
though in the following year two of them yielded, Bernard
Benson paying up the large arrears of 15s. 11d. for
"Church: Sess," and Jacob Holme 7s. 6d., the "Allowance
for Dissenters" appears each year on the debit side.</p>

<p>Presentments are only available from 1702. The
following extracts give the names of the non-payers of
the two townships. Those of Langdale would appear
in their separate presentment:&mdash;</p>

<p>This Francis Benson, the third Friend of his name
at the Fold, is the last we know of. As the old families
died out or dispersed, no new adherents of the sect
appear to have arisen in the parish, and dissent ceased.</p>

<p>The only comment on non-conformity found in the
registers occurs in the second volume (1687-1713).
It runs:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A perticular Register of some pretended Marryages of the people
called Quakers within the parish of Grasmere As followeth&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>But only two weddings from Great Langdale are set
down. Also is entered:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Jane daughter of John Grigge of Stile End in Great Langdale
was baptized by A prebyterian minister the tenth day of Aprill
Ano Dom 1710.</p></blockquote>

<p>The "minister" so clearly obnoxious to the registrar
may have been a visitor to the valley.</p>

<p>When a stranger entered the church in 1827 and asked
the clerk if there were any Dissenters in the neighbourhood,
he was told that there were none nearer than
Keswick, where were some who called themselves Presbyterians;
and of these the clerk professed so little
knowledge that he hazarded the suggestion that they
were a kind of "papishes." The clerk aforesaid was
old George Mackereth,<a name="FNanchor_193_194" id="FNanchor_193_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_194" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> forgetful alike of the Colthouse
Meeting-House and the small Baptist Chapel at Hawkshead
Hill, built in 1678? For about the first clustered
a few families who clung to the faith of their fathers;
though the latter (of which little seems to be known)
may have dropped out of use.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>
<p>Dissent had never existed in Ambleside. The men of
that town, who managed the affairs of their chapel, had
no real leanings towards it, and the Restoration found
them all churchmen again. The only man of the town-division
who could be taxed as a non-communicant in
1675 was Roger Borwick, and he was a disreputable
inn-keeper at Miller Bridge, a Roman Catholic who had
once been a personal servant of the ill-fated heir of
Squire John Fleming.</p>

<h2><a name="REGISTERS" id="REGISTERS"></a>THE REGISTERS</h2>


<p>The early registers are contained in three parchment
books. The first measures 15 inches by 7, and
has a thickness of 1 inch. It was re-bound recently in
white vellum, and an expert has endeavoured to restore
the almost vanished characters of the first page. The
earliest legible entries are for January 1570-71. The
sheets may have once got loose and some lost, for there
is a complete gap between the years 1591-98, and another
between 1604-11. There are minor gaps besides, which,
perhaps, may be explained by the system of register
keeping that obtained in these parts. A smaller book
for entries was kept, called a pocket-register, in which
the minister (or the clerk) noted down the ceremonies
as they occurred; and these were copied from time to
time into the larger book. It was a system that, in the
hands of careless officials, produced nothing short of
disaster, as far as parochial history is considered. The
re-entry, long over-due, had often not been made, before
the pocket-register was mis-placed or lost. In times of
stress, like those of the plague-years, the church officials
seem to have become paralized, and ceased to cope for
months at a time with the registration of the dead. For
instance, in the deadly year 1577, February, April, May
and July are blank; eight burials are then entered for
August, and none for the rest of the year. Again, next
year, eight deaths are recorded for July, nine for
September, and twelve for November, while the intervening
and succeeding months are blank. This state
of things continues through the years of oft-returning
plague that followed, and through the long rectorate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
of John Wilson, diversified by the occasional loss of a
page or a mysterious skip, <em>e.g.</em>, in marriages there is a
gap between the years 1583-4 and 1611&mdash;more than
27 years.<a name="FNanchor_194_195" id="FNanchor_194_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_195" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>The first register-book is, therefore, a disappointing
document, from which no satisfactory conclusions as to
population or death-rate can be drawn, nor adequate
information concerning families or individuals. The
Hawkshead register-book is a complete contrast to this
one, in neatness and fulness; and the scribe has marked
with a cross all deaths from plague. Maybe the grammar-school
there, with its master, affected favourably the
records of the parish. In Grasmere the school was,
after the Reformation, left in general to the parish clerk.
This first book shows signs, like the Curate's Bible of
Ambleside, of having been accessible to the scholars&mdash;no
doubt while these were yet taught in the church;
for experiments in penmanship and signatures occur on
blank spaces, which were seized upon with avidity by
the learner&mdash;parchment and paper being hard to come by.</p>

<p>The condition of the third register-book is wholly
satisfactory. It is in its original binding, but the clasps
have gone. It measures 16<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> inches by 7, with a thickness
of 3 inches. Its title runs, "Grasmere's Register Book,
from May the 7th, <small>A.D.</small>, 1713. Henry Fleming, D.D.,
Rector; Mr. Dudley Walker, Curate; Anthony Harrison,
Parish Clerk." The book closes in December, 1812.
As in the earlier volumes, the baptisms and marriages
are written on the left page, and burials on the right.
The first entry is a receipt from the man who furnished
the book:&mdash;</p>

<p><br />Some entries of confirmations were made in this volume.
The first has caused considerable surprise, and it is of
interest on three scores. It shows that the solemnization
of the rite had been long neglected&mdash;the Bishop of Chester
no doubt finding this remote parish of his diocese very
inconvenient to reach, and relegating it on this occasion
to his brother of Carlisle, who but recently was its rector.
It likewise proves that the population was larger then
than in the next century, and that the estimate of the
number of communicants given on a preceding page
was under, rather than over, stated. It illustrates the
fact, besides, that the old forms would accommodate
at least twice the number of the present benches.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">October the 23, 1737.</p>

<p>A Confirmation was then holden at this Church by the Right
Reverend Father in God Sr. George Fleming Baronet Lord
Bishop of Carlisle at the instance of the Lord Bishop of Chester
at which time and place About five Hundred Persons were Confirmed.
[The next confirmation recorded is in 1862.]</p></blockquote>

<p>An entry on the first page, in fine hand-writing, is
likewise of interest, as showing that long after the Reformation,
and even after the Prayer Book revision of 1662,
the prohibition of the old Sarum Manual against marriages
taking place during the three great feasts of Christmas,
Easter and Penticost still had weight, though it could
not be enforced, and that the rector&mdash;a stout churchman&mdash;desired
its observance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>Curious entries, or any bearing upon local history,
such as are frequent in some registers, are scarce in the

woollen for shrouds, by way of propping up a declining

<p>This poor youth was probably of the Rydal stock of
Harrisons, where several generations of Davids had
flourished as statesmen, carriers and inn-keepers.<a name="FNanchor_197_198" id="FNanchor_197_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_198" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> The

<p>An instance of longevity is given in 1674, when widow
Elizabeth Walker, of Underhelme, "dyed at ye age of
107 years old."</p>

<p>But the entry that has caused the most comment is
one that commemorates a boating disaster on Windermere
Lake. Forty-seven persons were drowned, with some
seven horses: "in one boate comeinge over from Hawkshead"
on October 20th, 1635. Singularly enough, this
is the only known record of an event with which tradition
and later story has been busy. These affirm that the
boat-load consisted of a wedding-party; also that the
corpses were buried under a yew-tree in Windermere
church-yard. If the catastrophe happened to the customery
ferry, known as Great Boat, plying between
Hawkshead Road and Ferry Nab, the interment would
naturally be made at that church, though an unfortunate
gap in the registers for the period prevents certainty on
the point. But why was the event written down at
Grasmere? It appears to have been inscribed by George
Bennison, clerk and schoolmaster, who did not enter
office till 1641. Had he the intention (unfortunately
unfulfilled) of recording local history in the register-book?
Could we suppose the Ambleside Fair for October
20th&mdash;an occasion of great resort only a few decades
later&mdash;to have been in vogue before its charter was
gained, the conjecture that the drowned folk had been
attending the fair might be entertained.<a name="FNanchor_198_199" id="FNanchor_198_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_199" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> There were
other passage-boats on the lake besides the Great one.
In connection with the number drowned, it may be
mentioned that ferry-boats were formerly of great size.

on her journey to cross the Mersey with her horses from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Cheshire to Liverpool&mdash;a passage which occupied 1<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub>

held 100 people.<a name="FNanchor_199_200" id="FNanchor_199_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_200" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>Miss Helen Sumner has been, since 1906, engaged in
a transcript of the first register-book. It is now complete,
and it will be put into use instead of the old illegible

<h2><a name="PRESENTMENTS" id="PRESENTMENTS"></a>PRESENTMENTS, BRIEFS, AND CHARITIES</h2>


<p>The Presentment for 1702 may be given fully as a
specimen of the document which the wardens
were bound to furnish at the Visitation of the Bishop
or his emissary. A few extracts may be added, for the
simplicity and shrewdness of some of the answers make
them entertaining, as in the entire repudiation of an
apparitor and his dues.</p>

<p>During Dr. Fleming's rectorate, a difference arose
between the officials who controlled the finance department
of the Visitation and the vestries of the parishes
of Windermere and Grasmere.<a name="FNanchor_200_201" id="FNanchor_200_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_201" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> It was proposed by the
latter to make one Presentment serve for the whole
parish, mother-church and chapels together; and the
rector of Grasmere stated that it was only through a
mis-conception that separate Presentments had been
made. This was a sound, economical plan for the parish,
but it was firmly opposed (as was natural) by the higher
officials, who affirmed that separate Presentments were
the rule. The table of "ancient and justifiable fees"
was given as follows:&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="right">£</td><td align="right">s.</td><td align="right">d.</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>Also apparitors received at the Visitation a fee for
carrying out books sent by the King and Council&mdash;as
Thanksgiving Books, etc.; and for each of these he
might claim a fee of 1s., which raised the sum total
to be paid at a Visitation occasionally to 14s. or 15s.
No wonder our wardens disclaimed all knowledge of the
apparitor! For their consolation they were reminded
that in other Jurisdictions the wardens were called to
Visitations twice a year, which doubled the fees and
expenses.</p>

<p>In 1691 the parish paid "To the Chancellor at the
Bishop's Visitation for a Presentment" 5s. 10d. The
writing of it cost 4s. 2d. A Book of Articles was bought
also. Five years later a Presentment for the whole
parish cost 13s. 2d.</p>

<p><br />The later presentments, up to 1732, are&mdash;except where quoted
from elsewhere&mdash;largely repetitions of this. One or two answers
to queries, however, are naive. In 1712 "we have no physitia's,
nor Sargions in or parish."</p>

<p>Concerning officers of Ecclesistiall Courts, we know not their
Officers; nor wh their Officers are; nor now they perform them,
well, or ill; nor wh their just Fees are, and can therefore give no
account of ym.</p>

any undue Fees exacted by them, and we think we ought not
to pr'sent any man for faults wch we know not by him."</p>

<p>Between 1702 and 1732 only one woman is "presented" for
"fornication"; and only occasionally, in a later set of Presentments,
between 1768 and 1796 is the fault&mdash;which the registers
show to have been not infrequent&mdash;mentioned.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Briefs.</span></p>

<p>Printed briefs, that called upon the churches to succour
the unfortunate by offerings in money, reached Grasmere,
remote as it was. Such of these sheets, as were found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
to be sufficiently intact, were quite recently gathered
together and bound as a volume. Within the register-book
the amount realised by some of these collections
is set down. At Christmas, 1668, the offering made
for the poor of London after the fire, reached the high
figure of £17 6s. 3d., which shows how that great calamity
affected the popular mind. Among other recipients of
the parochial bounty are found: "Captives at allgeeres"
(Algiers), 3s. 1d., also "A breife beyond ye seaes and for
ye suply of printing The bible for one John de Krins..y,"
7s. 3d. Very frequently individuals or towns that had
suffered loss from fire or other causes were relieved.
Perhaps there was grumbling then, as now, at the many
collections, and 8d. only was realised for the relief of
Hartlepool. The Squire, who generally gave one shilling
for a brief, was doubtless absent that day.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Charities.</span></p>

<p>The care of the poor was of old a parochial matter.
The regular supply of money for this purpose came
from the offertories at the great feasts of the church,
and was distributed (at least after the Reformation, if
not before) by the wardens. There were other and
casual sources, such as the doles given at the funeral
of a person of gentle birth. The scale of the dole differed
according to the rank of the individual. In the seventeenth
century four pence (the old silver penny) was the
usual sum, though at the funeral of William Fleming,
of Coniston (claimant to Rydal Manor), only 2d. was
given. Squire John Fleming was buried quietly, on the
evening of his death, like many another recusant. There
was no time, therefore, for that extraordinary and seemingly
magnetic gathering of the poor, that sometimes
occurred, even on a day's notice&mdash;for such news sped
like a telegraphic message.</p>

<p>But some indigent folk collected next morning, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
£1 10s. was distributed. This, at 4d. a piece, would
represent 90 persons. The concourse was far greater
when Squire Daniel's wife was interred, when it numbered
over 1,800 persons; the amount given reaching £30
10s. 4d., while the dole-givers spent at the inn 3s. 6d.
The gathering at his little son's funeral, two years later
(1677), was naturally smaller. The entry in the account-book
is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The first bequest on record to the poor of Grasmere
is that of old Mrs. Agnes Fleming, the shrewd mistress
of Rydal Hall. Her will, dated 1630, directs that threescore
and ten pounds shall be devoted to the poor of
Staveley and "Gressmire," the interest to be distributed
every Good Friday. In this distribution George Dawson
"beinge blinde" was to receive during his life-time a
noble, which was 6s. 8d. or half a mark. Accordingly,
after her death, the bailiff entered in his accounts £1 13s.
as "paid the poor folke at Easter 1632 for my old mis";
the blind lad's noble was also set down. This charity
seems, however, to have been lost during the "Troubles"
that presently overtook family and country. An effort
to re-institute the one at Staveley at least was made
by Squire Daniel.</p>

<p>Mention of an extraordinary gift appears in the same
account-book. The young Earl of Thanet had lately,
as Lord Lieutenant of Westmorland, entered the county
in great state, and with a lavish expenditure of money.
His generosity (which may have had a political bias)
extended even to this remote quarter of the Barony.
In those days £10 was a large sum; and the coin (as a
precise entry under February, 1685, informs us) was
conveyed to Kendal by a servant, delivered to the mayor,
who passed it on to the Rydal Squire. One half was
for Windermere, the other for Grasmere; and one wonders
how large was the gathering at the church for the dole.</p>

<p>Other charitable gifts to the poor are written on boards
hanging in the church, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>Edward Partridge and others of Grasmere £50, the
interest to be distributed on St. Thomas's Day to such
poor as do not receive parochial relief. (Undated.)</p>

<p>William and Eleanor Waters, in 1807, £200, the interest
to be distributed under the like restrictions on Lady Day.</p>

<h2><a name="RUSHBEARING" id="RUSHBEARING"></a>THE RUSHBEARING</h2>


<p>It is impossible, in an account of Grasmere, to pass
over the Rushbearing, a Church Festival that has
come down from ancient times, and which, after a period
of languishment, has revived once more into a popular
pageant.</p>

<p>It may be the remnant of some fair or wake held on St.
Oswald's Eve and Day, and organized by the early church
to supersede some Pagan Feast of the late summer. The
close of July, or the early part of August, was a good
time for merry-making in these parts; for then the
husbandman's chief harvests were gathered in&mdash;the wool
from the sheep, and the hay from the meadows; while
the little patches of oats were hardly ready for the sickle.
We hear of a great pageant and play devised by Thomas
Hoggart<a name="FNanchor_201_202" id="FNanchor_201_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_202" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> being performed in the open air at Troutbeck
village (1693) on "St. James his Day," which was the
25th of July, equal to the 5th of August, new style.</p>

<p>The Rushbearing at Grasmere was held in recent times
on the Saturday nearest to July 20th; and a stranger,
T. Q. M., found a celebration taking place in 1827 on
July 21st.<a name="FNanchor_202_203" id="FNanchor_202_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_203" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> In fact, the Day of the church's dedicatory
Saint, August 5th (which is equal to August 16th, new
style) seems not to have been associated recently in the
minds of the people with the Festival; though it was
associated at St. Oswald, Warton, where the ceremony
survived till the close of the eighteenth century. It is
possible that the shift from old to new style, in 1752,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
weakened the connection between Saint's Day and
Festival in the minds of the folk, leaving them content
to await the summons of the clerk, who reminded them,
it is said, when it was time to cut the rushes. The old
chapels of the parish likewise had their Rushbearing.
That of Langdale appears in the wardens' accounts for
that township, where 2s. 6d. was generally put down
for expenses attending it. The item disappears, however,
after 1752, for then the chapel was rebuilt, and was no
doubt paved throughout with the fine slate of the valley:
the need for rushes there being over, more than 80 years
earlier than was the case with the mother church. The
Ambleside Festival has continued to the present day
(though with a lapse of a few years, according to Grasmere
folk), and is regularly held near the day of her Saint (Anne),
July 26th, the hymn used being the same as at Grasmere.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the Rushbearing had of old a real
meaning, for the sweet rushes were strewn over the
floors of churches and halls alike, both for warmth and
cleanliness.<a name="FNanchor_203_204" id="FNanchor_203_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_204" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> The covering was particularly necessary
in churches where the soil beneath the worshippers' feet
was full of corpses. The great annual strewing (though
we would fain believe that it was done oftener than once
a year) was naturally performed when rushes were full
grown. It was a boon service given to the church by
the folk during a spell of leisure. Such service they
were well accustomed to. The statesman not only by
custom immemorial, gave to his lord a day's labour at
harvest time, but he and his wife cheerfully turned into
their neighbour's field for the like. Sheep-clipping has
survived as a boon service; and what a man in old days
gave to his fellow, he did not grudge to his church.</p>

<p>Food and drink alone were the boon-workers' meed of
old; and the first entry that concerns the Rushbearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
in the wardens' accounts shows that the drink at least
was looked for.</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left"><p class="hanging">1680&mdash;"For Ale bestowed on those who brought Rushes and repaired the Church</p></td><td align="right">00</td><td align="right">01</td><td align="right">00"</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>It appears from this entry that the boon service was
not limited to rush-bearing in old times; but that general
repair was done by willing craftsmen. The item for ale
continues "on Rush-bearers and others"; in 1684 it
rises to 2s., and to 5s. 6d. next year. The amount was
perhaps considered excessive by the more temperate of
the parishioners&mdash;a runlet could be had for 3s.&mdash;and
from 1690 the charge "To Rushbearers" became a fixed
one of 2s. 6d. At this figure it stood for 150 years, though
from 1774 the township of Grasmere added on its own
account a further 1s. for "Getting of rushes for the
church."</p>

<p>The parochial charge "To Rushes for Church," 2s. 6d.
appears for the last time in 1841. With the paving of
the floor, which took place in 1840, the need for the
fragrant covering was over, and matting was laid down&mdash;probably
only in the aisles&mdash;in 1844, at an expense
of 11s. 4d.</p>

<p>Up to then rush-strewing had been necessary. Burials
in the earthen floor had continued up to 1823; and the
forms, from the gradual sinking of the ground, had to
be constantly lifted and re-set. Only in 1828 the townships
had gone to considerable expense in re-seating
and re-flagging their portions of the interior, and in the
same year a stray visitor to Grasmere expressed himself
as shocked at the primitive condition of the church.
"I found the very seat floors all unpaved, unboarded,
and the bare ground only strewed with rushes."<a name="FNanchor_204_205" id="FNanchor_204_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_205" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> In
the previous year T. Q. M. had found the villagers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
seriously working at their annual task of strewing. It
seems to have been done informally, under the superintendence
of the clerk; and later in the day&mdash;nine
o'clock it is said&mdash;came the spectacle and the merry-making.
A procession was formed, when the wild
flowers&mdash;which the children had been busily engaged
during the day in gathering and weaving into garlands&mdash;were
carried to the church and laid there. An adjournment
was then made to a hay-loft, where dancing was
kept up till midnight, and where no doubt more than
the parochial ale was drunk. Old James Dawson, the
fiddler, boasted to the stranger that he had for forty-six
years performed on the occasion. He complained of
the outlandish tunes introduced by the "Union Band
chaps," who had apparently superceded him in the
honour of leading the procession. But James may be
said to lead the music in spirit yet, for a certain march,
used for an unknown period and handed down by his
son Jimmy (who succeeded him as village fiddler), is
still played.</p>

<p>Clarke was present at the Festival at an earlier date,<a name="FNanchor_205_206" id="FNanchor_205_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_206" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>
and he gives a rather different account of it. His description,
however, is of something he had seen in the past;
and one is inclined to doubt that the Rushbearing was
ever held at the end of September. According to him,
the rushes were actually borne in the procession, which
was headed by girls carrying nosegays, the chief of
whom (called the Queen) had a large garland. When
the work of strewing was done, and the flowers laid in
the church, the concourse was met at the church door
by the fiddler, who played them to the ale-house, there
to spend an evening of jollity.</p>

<p>An account of the ceremony at Warton, earlier still,<a name="FNanchor_206_207" id="FNanchor_206_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_207" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
gives an interesting variation of custom. Here the floral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
decorations were not separate from the rushes, but
covered the bundles as crowns. The smartest of them,
trimmed with fine ribbon and flowers, were carried in
front by girls. The crowns were detached in the church,
and after the strewing of the rushes were left as ornaments.
Artificial trimmings were in use in Grasmere in 1828,
for the stranger's eye had been "particularly attracted
by the paper garlands which I found deposited in the
vestry; they were curiously and tastefully cut, and I
was almost tempted to buy one of them." The sketch
by Allom of the Ambleside Festival in 1833 shows how
elaborate and artificial the bearings had become.<a name="FNanchor_207_208" id="FNanchor_207_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_208" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> But
taste and meaning could not have been altogether banished
for certain sacred emblems and devices were cherished;
and Moses in the Bulrushes, and the Serpent in the
Wilderness&mdash;the latter wholly composed of rushes&mdash;which
are still carried as "bearings" at Grasmere, are said
to have been handed down from a forgotten past. The
same is claimed for the Ambleside Harp, the strings of
which are contrived from the pith of the rush&mdash;the
"sieve" of the olden days of rush-lights.</p>

<p>It has been seen that the joint payment by the townships
for the boon service ceased when the actual rush-strewing
ceased. But the Festival continued, though it
was clearly changing its character and becoming the
children's Feast of Flowers. This is shown by Grasmere's
special contribution to the occasion. The annual gift,
after rising a little, is entered in 1819 as 3s. 9d., "To
Rushbearers' Gingerbread paid Geo: Walker." From
that time Grasmere's expenditure for "Rushbearers
bread" is a constant though varying item. In 1839 it
dropped as low as 1s. 6d., which, supposing two-pennyworth
to be the amount given to each child, would represent
but nine bearers. From this low figure however it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
rose; and the languishing Festival was revived, if not
saved, by the munificence of Mr. Thomas Dawson, of
Allan Bank, who began about this time to present each
bearer with 6d.<a name="FNanchor_208_209" id="FNanchor_208_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_209" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> The gingerbread item was often
6s.; in 1847 it was 9s. 10d.; in 1851 it is set down as
"To Rushbearers 62," 10s. 4d. In 1856 13s. 6d. was paid
to A. Walker for "Rushbearers Cake," and in the next
two years the climax was reached by the sums £1. 1s. 5d.
and £1. 1s. The long-continued item then abruptly
ceases&mdash;seventeen years after the provision made for
ale by the whole parish ceased&mdash;swept away no doubt
by the revolution in church-management and church-rates,
and for thirteen years there is a gap. When,
however, the ancient but now resisted church-rate was
dropped in 1871, and all expenses were defrayed from
the large and gladly-paid offertory, the church again
provided for the Festival. The expenses were now put
down under "Rushbearing," as Bells 6s., Wilson 8s.,
Cakes 19s.; amounting to £1 13s., towards which the
collection at the church service (for the first time established)
furnished 16s. 8d. Next year there was a marked
increase: Band £2, Joiners 8s., Ringers 6s., Gingerbread
£1. 5s. 10d., and Baldry 4s. 1d.; total £4. 3s. 11d.;
collection, £2. 18s. 1d. The payment to joiners must
have been for making the frames of the bearings, which
have assumed many varied forms.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>
<p>The Festival has, since 1885, taken place on the Saturday
next to St. Oswald's Day. The procession, from
which everything gaudy and irreverent has been eliminated,
now makes a beautiful spectacle. Children of all
ages take part in it, even tiny toddlers, supported by
parent or grandmother. The floral burdens are deposited
in the church and the service held, when all disperse;
and on the next Monday the children have their feast
with games and prizes, paid for by the united contribution
of the parishioners.</p>

<p>The Walker family, who for so long provided the gingerbread,
are remembered to have had a little shop&mdash;the
only one in the place&mdash;and it stood near the present one
of Messrs. Gibson.<a name="FNanchor_209_210" id="FNanchor_209_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_210" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Presumably, Dinah, the wife,
baked the cake; and George, in the manner of the time,
pursued the additional trade of tailor. Mrs. Mary Dixon,
of Town End, was the gingerbread maker for many years,
but has recently given it up.</p>

chaplains at both, while he also paid a small sum annually to the mother
church in token of subjection."] From the rural deanery of Kendal there
were paid the following dues, according to an old voucher, c. 1320: at Easter
12s. 0d. for Synodalia; at Michaelmas £4 16s 8d for Procurationes; besides £3

<p><a name="Footnote_32_32" id="Footnote_32_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_32"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> The early practice of burial in distant churches is inexplicable to this age.
But it should be remembered that in early days man was a peripatetic animal,
to whom the distance between Grasmere and Kendal, or Hawkshead and
Dalton, would be slight; and that a corpse wrapped in a winding-sheet would
be much lighter than one coffined.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_33_33" id="Footnote_33_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_33"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> Of the first, still paid, there is plenty of evidence. It was even allowed
during the Commonwealth. In 1645 the Rydal Hall account-sheets show
that arrears were paid to the Kendal parson out of the tithes "upon order
for 5 yeares stypd out of Gresmire," amounting to £3 6s 8d or five marks.
Next year is entered "Rent due to mr. M. out of Gresmire tithes" 13s 6d.
The order came from the Puritan Committee at Kendal.
</p>
<p>
A mortuary, or corpse present, was distinct from a burial fee, and was
supposed to cover any obligation forgotten by the dead man to church or
priest. The claim anciently was upon his second best animal, the best going
to his feudal lord; but it came to be paid in coin; while a law was passed
(21 Henry VIII.) limiting the sum to 10s., and that only when the deceased
owned goods to the value of £40. Dr. Cox, <cite>Parish Registers of England</cite>. The
following receipt is in existence for a fee paid to Kendal on the death of Edward
Walker of Rydal, who was buried in his parish church of Grasmere:&mdash;

<p><a name="Footnote_36_36" id="Footnote_36_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36_36"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> There is a tradition that a route from Skelwith Bridge dropped sharply
from the top of Red Bank to the old ford of the Rothay known as Bathwath
(Rydal Hall MSS.), and that it had even been used for funerals. This seems
unlikely, unless the use were a repetition of a custom that had prevailed
before the present Red Bank road was made; and of superstitious adherence
to old corpse-roads the Rev. J. C. Atkinson (<cite>Forty Years in a Moorland Parish</cite>)
gives instances. There may indeed have been once a well-trodden path there.
In former times a fulling-mill stood on the left bank of the Rothay, near to
the ford, and within the freehold property of Bainrigg. The mill was owned
by the Benson family in the fifteenth century, but Bainrigg had belonged
before that time to a family of de Bainbrigg, who had at least one capital
dwelling or mansion-house standing upon it. Now a road to this house or
houses there must have been. The woodman recently found a track leading
up from the site of the mill to the rocky height, which emerged upon the
present Wishing-Gate road. On the line of this (which was engineered as a
turnpike road only about 1770-80) the older way doubtless continued towards
Grasmere, past How Top and through Town End. A huge stone standing
on this line was known as the How Stone. Levi Hodgson who lived at How
Top, and who described the route to Mr. W. H. Hills, remembered fragments
of a cottage in the wood. If the Skelwith Bridge folk ever used it as a church
path, they would meet their townsmen (who had come over White Moss) at
How Top. Close by there is still a flat-topped boulder used for resting burdens
upon.</p></div>

disappeared at the widening of the lane from Stock Bridge to the church.</p></div>

the administration of the sacrament, or the number of times it was
received yearly by the laity. As early as 750, laymen who failed to communicate
at Christmas, Easter, and Pentecost, were not esteemed christians; they
were expected to make offerings four times a year. A later rule, which was
stringent, seems to have been once a year, though a more frequent attendance&mdash;specially
at Easter and Christmas, was urged. See Abbot Gasquet's <cite>Parish
Life in Medieval England</cite>, Wall's <cite>Old English Parishes</cite>, p. 90, and Wordsworth's
<cite>Medieval Services in England</cite>. The sacrament was called <em>housel</em>, and the
bread <em>houselling-bread</em>. Henry VII's queen, Elizabeth of York, appears to
have communicated three times a year, at the festivals of Easter, All Saints,
and Christmas (Canon Simmon's <cite>Notes to the Lay Folks' Mass Book</cite>, p. 239).
Queen Victoria no doubt clung to an old custom when she communicated
no oftener than three or four times a year. (See <cite>Life</cite>.)</p></div>

was at its height. There were 1300 "houseling people" reported for the
parish of Windermere in 1549 (Commission quoted in Mr. Brydson's <cite>Sidelights
on Mediæval Windermere</cite>, p. 95), and there is no reason to suppose that Grasmere
was far behind. At the same time the numbers to collect at one celebration
would be considerably lessened if the Easter communion were spread over
several occasions, as was the case in the late seventeenth century at Clayworth,
Notts, where celebrations were held on Palm Sunday, Good Friday, as well
as Easter Day. All parishioners&mdash;to judge from the rector's careful record&mdash;must
at this season have communicated; but at the celebrations of Whitweek
and Christmas (for there was none at Michaelmas) the numbers were
much lower. (<cite>Rector's Book of Clayworth</cite>).</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_41_41" id="Footnote_41_41"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_41"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> We have no evidence of this to show for Grasmere Church. But in 1622
"Sir" Richard Pearson, curate of Troutbeck, was empowered by the rector
of Windermere to publicly revoke the sentence of excommunication under
which one Adam Birkhead lay. An edict was issued from the registry of the
Archdeaconry of Richmondshire as late as 1715, citing a form of penance to
be gone through by George Birkett, who before the congregation of Troutbeck,
and in "penitential habit," was to confess his grievous sin of incest with his
deceased wife's sister. An additional note, however, empowered Mr. Barton,
rector of Windermere, and Mr. Grisedale, curate, to use their discretion as to
the manner of confession, and to allow the sinner, if properly penitent, to
make it "in his Ordinary apparell" (Browne MSS.). It may have been the
dislike of public penance, with its peculiar habit, that caused the churchwardens
of Grasmere so often, and so incorrectly, to return a clean bill of morality
in their Presentments.</p></div>

wood, besides providing for the upkeep of the sea-dyke. See "The Sixteen
Men of Holme Cultram," <cite>Transactions</cite>, Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian
Society, <small>N.S.</small>, 3. The Eighteen of Aston, Oxfordshire, were found
in 1583 to have control over the common field and meadow, with the yearly
allotments made within them. See "Survival of Archaic Communities,"
Prof. F. W. Maitland (<cite>Law Quarterly Review</cite>, vol. 9). Prof. Maitland regards
the existence of this body as an exceptional case, and thinks it dangerous to
assume it to have been a survival of ancient times. Mr. G. G. Coulton in
<cite>Chaucer and his England</cite> considers that the Black Death of 1348-9 and the consequent
diminution of the clergy may have thrown the people on their own
resources, and caused the lay control over parish finances which appears to
have dated (he says) from the fifteenth century.</p></div>

son (then under age) as a landholder, adds "and it is my mind and will that
my said son Richard shall sitt next his elder brother Edward in the same
forme, and likewise to haue another seate for a woman in the other forme,
or seate accustomed for women." This was in Ambleside Chapel, but the
custom was general.
</p>
<p>
Mr. George Browne possesses a copy of a document drawn up in 1629, after
there had been contention, which gives the order of seating in Troutbeck
Chapel. As this has not been printed, it may be briefly summarized here.
A plan accompanies the paper. The general order was, for the men to be
seated round the chancel, and upon a certain number of the front benches
on the north side, which was free. The women were behind the men, five
being placed on each form. They paid for their seats, at a diminishing rate
from the front, the price starting at 20d.&mdash;one-eighth of a mark. The plan
gives the place of every townswoman, and it is expressly stated that if there
be a young wife in the family as well as an old one, she is to take her place
on another form.</p></div>

the Court of High Commission for drunkenness and other misdemeanors,
in the evidence this appears: "At Easter gone twelve monethes at Easter
last, examinate (the witness) did receive the Holie Communion, and Methwen,
when he did distribute the wine, did holde the same in his owne hand and
would not deliver it into examinate's handes for to drinke, as he thinketh
he ought to have done; for examinate in regard to his holdinge on it in that
manner, could scarcelie taste of the wine. Methwen did serve some others
at that time in the like manner, whoe tooke offence thereat."&mdash;<cite>History of

Antiquarian Society, vol. 14, p. 283. It seems strange that there was no
reliable bell-founder in Kendal, where, in the seventeenth century, there
was a goodly number of workers in metal. (See <cite>Boke off Recorde</cite>.) Of these
the Washingtons were apparently the most accredited workmen. A Richard
of the name "besydes Kendal" at the Dissolution, bought the house of the
Friars in Penrith, with its bell. (<cite>Transactions</cite>, Cumberland and Westmorland
Antiquarian Society, vol. 6, p. 435.) The Richard of the next century was
busy with arms during the Civil Wars, and worked for Rydal Hall. Mr. R.
Godfrey ("Westmorland Bells," <cite>Transactions</cite>, Cumberland and Westmorland
Antiquarian Society, vol. 6, p. 84) considers that the Crosthwaite bell, dated
1695, was cast by Christopher Hodson in Kendal. In the preceding century
one of this name (spelt Hodgson) appears among the freemen of the city,
while a John and a Robert stand in the later list of freemen armourers and
hardwaremen, though the mark for "foreigner" stands after their names.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_181_182" id="Footnote_181_182"></a><a href="#FNanchor_181_182"><span class="label">[181]</span></a> From a recent work, <cite>Educational Charters and Documents</cite>, by H. F. Leach,
we learn that the clergy taught both themselves and others from the earliest
times; for instance, in the seventh century, Aldhelm, writing to the Bishop
about his studies, tells him how after long struggles he grasped at last, in a
moment, by God's grace, "the most difficult of all things, what they call
fractions." In the tenth century a canon of King Edgar enjoins that "every
priest in addition to lore to diligently learn a handicraft," and later in the
same century the Council enacted that "priests shall keep schools in the
villages and teach small boys without charge," and also that they ought always
to have schools for teachers, "Ludi magistrorum scholas" in their houses, thus
they would prepare others to take up the work professionally which they
were doing for nothing. Five hundred years later we find it ordered at Bridgenorth,
in 1503, that "no priste keep no scole, after that a scole mastur comyth
to town, but that every child to resorte to the comyn scole." But the plague
broke out and swept away "scole masturs" and pupils alike, and in 1529
the Convocation of Canterbury once more bade all rectors, vicars, and charity
priests to employ some part of their time in teaching boys the alphabet,
reading, singing, or grammar; and appointed a Revision Committee of one
archbishop, four bishops, four abbots, and four archdeacons to bring out
a uniform Latin grammar for all schools. That grammar was taught in Latin
in the tenth and eleventh centuries we know from the Colloquy of &OElig;lfric,
1005, and from his preface to the first English-Latin grammar, in which
teachers were told that "It is better to invoke God the Father giving him
honour by lengthening the syllable (P&#257;ter) rather than cutting it short (P&#259;ter); no, comparing pronunciation
as is the Britons' way, for God ought not to be subject to the rules of grammar."

as told in the <cite>Rushbearing</cite> pamphlet, p. 24, where the Festival of 1885 is
described, but apparently the date 1834 should be 1839. "Before leaving
the church-yard, the children, to the number of about 115, were each given
a sixpenny piece, in accordance with the custom that has prevailed for over
the last fifty years. The origin of this gift of sixpence will perhaps be of
interest to many. In 1834 there were only seven rushbearers, and it seemed
that this revered custom was on the decline. Mr. Dawson, of London, and
owner of Allan Bank, was present, and he gave each of the rushbearers sixpence,
which gift he has continued yearly ever since. The next year the
numbers of bearers was increased to fifty, and year by year this figure has
been added to. It is said that Mr. Dawson does not intend to continue his
gift any longer, so that it appears the year 1885 will be the last one in which
the children will receive their brand new sixpence, unless someone takes
the matter in hand, or Mr. Dawson reconsiders his decision."</p></div>
